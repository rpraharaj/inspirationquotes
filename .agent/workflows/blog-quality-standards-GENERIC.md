## 1. Human Voice Requirements

### Voice & Tone

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Tone** | Professional but warm—like explaining to a smart colleague |
| **Perspective** | Generic first-person ("I've seen...", "In my experience...") |
| **Style** | Conversational, not academic. Write like you talk (but polished) |

### Required Elements Checklist

Every blog post MUST include:

- [ ] **Personal opening** - Start with story/observation, NOT "In this guide..."
- [ ] **First-person experiences** - At least 2-3 "I've seen...", "When I..." moments
- [ ] **Opinions expressed** - At least 1-2 clear stances or "hot takes"
- [ ] **Uncertainty admitted** - At least 1 "I'm not sure...", "Even experts disagree..."
- [ ] **Contractions used** - Consistent use of don't, it's, they're, etc.
- [ ] **Conversational transitions** - "Here's the thing...", "That said...", NOT "Additionally,"
- [ ] **Light humor** - 1-2 witty observations or self-deprecating moments
- [ ] **Sentence variety** - Mix of short (5 words) and medium (15-20 words)

### Human Voice Scoring (For Review & Validation)

| Element | Score 0 | Score 1 | Score 2 | Minimum |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Personal anecdotes** | None | 1-2 | 3+ | 2 |
| **Opinions/hot takes** | None | 1 | 2+ | 1 |
| **Contractions** | Formal | Mixed | Natural | 2 |
| **Sentence variety** | Uniform | Some | Dynamic | 2 |
| **Uncertainty shown** | None | Some | Authentic | 1 |
| **Light humor** | None | Present | Well-placed | 1 |

**Minimum Total Score: 10/12** (posts scoring below this FAIL validation)

### Good vs Bad Examples

#### Opening Sentences

| ❌ Fails Test | ✅ Passes Test |
|---------------|----------------|
| "Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing..." | "Last month, something made me stop and think." |
| "In today's rapidly evolving..." | "Here's a confession: I didn't get [topic] at first." |
| "This comprehensive guide will..." | "Let's talk about something that's changing everything." |

#### Transitions

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use Instead |
|----------|----------------|
| "Additionally," | "Also," or just start the sentence |
| "Furthermore," | "And," or restructure |
| "Moreover," | Remove or rephrase naturally |
| "In conclusion..." | Just write the conclusion |

---

## 2. AI Banned Phrases

### ZERO TOLERANCE - Automatic Validation Failure

These phrases MUST NOT appear anywhere in the content:

```
❌ "In this comprehensive guide..."
❌ "Whether you're a [X] or a [Y]..."
❌ "By the end of this article..."
❌ "It's important to note that..."
❌ "In today's rapidly evolving..."
❌ "This article will explore..."
❌ "In conclusion..." (just write the conclusion)
```

### WARNING - Minimize or Rephrase

These patterns should be avoided or replaced:

| Pattern | Problem | Better Alternative |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| "significantly" (without data) | Vague intensifier | Be specific with numbers |
| "incredibly" | AI cliché | Use concrete descriptor |
| "transforming" (vague) | Overused | Describe HOW |
| "leveraging" | Corporate-speak | "using" |
| "utilize" | Unnecessarily formal | "use" |
| "in order to" | Wordy | "to" |

---

## 3. Information Currency Rules

### The Golden Rule

**All content must use the CURRENT DATE from the system context as the reference point.**

The system provides the current date in format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+TZ`

### Date Requirements

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **pubDate** | Use today's date from system context |
| **Year references** | Use current year (e.g., "in 2026", "as of 2026") |
| **Statistics** | Must be from current year or previous year |
| **Product info** | Reference current versions only |

### Source Age Limits

| Topic Type | Maximum Source Age |
|------------|--------------------|
| Tech/AI topics | 1 year max |
| General topics | 2-3 years max |
| Historical context | Properly labeled as historical |

### Search Query Tips

When researching, include date qualifiers:
```
"[topic] [current year]" OR "[topic] [previous year]"
"[topic] statistics [current year]"
"[topic] latest research"
```

---

## 4. AI Model Version Requirements

### When This Applies

For ANY content mentioning AI models, tools, or platforms.

### Required Searches

Before writing AI-related content, search for latest versions:

```
"OpenAI GPT latest model [current month year]"
"Claude Anthropic latest model [current month year]"
"Google Gemini latest model [current month year]"
"[specific tool] what AI model does it use [year]"
```

### What to Capture

| Category | What to Verify |
|----------|----------------|
| **Model Versions** | Current version numbers (e.g., GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5) |
| **Release Dates** | When current versions were released |
| **Context Windows** | Current context window sizes |
| **Pricing** | Current pricing tiers |
| **Key Features** | New capabilities in latest versions |
| **Deprecated Models** | Which old versions are retired |

### Common Outdated References to Flag

**FAIL if found without historical context:**
- Referencing old AI model versions as current
- Outdated context window sizes
- Deprecated features presented as available
- Old pricing structures

**Note:** Always verify current model names and versions via web search before publishing AI-related content.

---

## 5. E-E-A-T Signals

### What E-E-A-T Means

| Signal | Meaning | How to Demonstrate |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **Experience** | First-hand experience with topic | Personal stories, "When I implemented..." |
| **Expertise** | Deep knowledge of subject | Technical depth, accurate terminology |
| **Authoritativeness** | Recognized credibility | Cite sources, link to official docs |
| **Trustworthiness** | Reliable, honest content | Update dates, balanced perspective, admit uncertainty |

### Minimum Requirements Per Post

- [ ] At least 2 first-person experience references
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified via fact-checking
- [ ] 2-3 links to authoritative external sources
- [ ] Balanced perspective (acknowledge limitations/alternatives)
- [ ] Admission of uncertainty on complex/debatable topics

---

## 6. Internal Linking Requirements

### Quantity

- **Minimum:** 3 internal links per post
- **Maximum:** 5-7 internal links (avoid over-linking)
- **Distribution:** Spread throughout article, not clustered

### Quality Rules

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Placement** | Within paragraph text, not standalone |
| **Anchor Text** | Descriptive, keyword-rich (NEVER "click here") |
| **Relevance** | Link must add value for reader |
| **Context** | Natural fit within the sentence |

### Format

```markdown
Learn more about [descriptive anchor text](/blog/related-post-slug).
```

---

## 7. External Linking Requirements

### Quantity

- **Minimum:** 2-3 external links per post
- **Maximum:** 5-6 external links
- **Distribution:** Spread throughout article, not clustered

### Required Format (Google-Compliant)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** ALL external links MUST use HTML format, NOT markdown.

**REQUIRED HTML Format:**
```html
<a href="https://example.com/page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Descriptive anchor text</a>
```

**Why HTML, NOT Markdown?**
- Ensures `target="_blank"` keeps users on your site
- Guarantees `rel="noopener"` for security (prevents tab hijacking)
- Google expects external links to open in new tabs for good UX
- More control over link behavior

### Required Attributes

| Attribute | Purpose | Required? |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `target="_blank"` | Opens link in new tab | ✅ ALWAYS |
| `rel="noopener"` | Security (prevent tabnapping) | ✅ ALWAYS |
| `rel="nofollow"` | Don't pass PageRank | Only for untrusted sources |
| `rel="sponsored"` | Paid/affiliate links | Only for affiliate links |
| `rel="ugc"` | User-generated content | Only for user-submitted links |

### Good vs Bad Examples

| ❌ WRONG (Markdown) | ✅ CORRECT (HTML) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| `[OpenAI](https://openai.com)` | `<a href="https://openai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI</a>` |
| `[Learn more](https://example.com)` | `<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Complete guide on Example</a>` |

### Anchor Text Best Practices

| ❌ BAD Anchor Text | ✅ GOOD Anchor Text |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| "click here" | "official documentation" |
| "this article" | "comprehensive research study" |
| "read more" | "the complete API reference" |
| Raw URL | Descriptive, keyword-rich text |

### Source Quality Hierarchy

Prioritize sources in this order:

| Priority | Source Type | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **1** | Official documentation | AWS docs, Google Cloud docs, GitHub repos |
| **2** | Primary sources | Company announcements, product pages |
| **3** | Research/reports | Gartner, McKinsey, academic papers |
| **4** | Authoritative media | Industry publications, respected tech media |
| **5** | Expert blogs | Well-known industry thought leaders |

### Sources to AVOID

- ❌ Low-quality content farms
- ❌ Outdated articles (>1-2 years for tech topics)
- ❌ Heavily affiliate-monetized sites
- ❌ Unverifiable personal blogs
- ❌ Sites with excessive ads/popups
- ❌ Sources without publication dates
- ❌ Direct competitor blogs (link to official sources instead)

### E-E-A-T Considerations

External links **boost E-E-A-T** when they:
- Cite authoritative sources
- Link to official documentation
- Reference primary research
- Support claims with evidence

**Do NOT use `nofollow` on legitimate editorial links** to authoritative sources—Google expects natural outbound linking.

---

## 8. Word Count Requirements

### Minimum Word Count

**Minimum: 2,500-3,000 words** (adjust based on your content strategy)

> **Note:** For highly competitive niches or in-depth topics, consider 4,000+ words

### Word Count Validation

| Count | Status |
|-------|--------|
| ≥ Target | ✅ PASS |
| Target - 500 words | ⚠️ WARN - Close to minimum |
| < Target - 500 words | ❌ FAIL - Content too thin |

### Guidelines

- Be comprehensive, not padded
- Each section should serve a purpose
- Follow Google's helpful content guidelines
- Longer is better ONLY if it adds value

---

## 9. SEO On-Page Requirements

### Title Tag

| Check | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Length | 50-60 characters |
| Keyword | Primary keyword near the front |
| Format | Compelling, click-worthy |

### Meta Description

| Check | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Length | 150-160 characters |
| Keyword | Include primary keyword |
| CTA | Include call-to-action |

### URL Slug

| Check | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Format | Short, descriptive, hyphens only |
| Keyword | Include primary keyword |
| Case | All lowercase |
| **No Years** | **Never include year (2024, 2025, 2026, etc.)** |

**⚠️ CRITICAL - Evergreen URL Rule:**

Do NOT include years in URL slugs. Years make content appear dated and reduce long-term SEO value.

| ❌ BAD (Dated) | ✅ GOOD (Evergreen) |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `best-tools-2026` | `best-tools` |
| `marketing-guide-2026` | `marketing-guide` |
| `trends-2026` | `current-trends` or `latest-trends` |

**Why this matters for SEO:**
- Content appears outdated when the year passes
- Reduced click-through rates in search results
- Unnecessary URL changes and redirects later
- Limits evergreen content potential

### Keyword Placement

| Location | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| First 100 words | Primary keyword must appear |
| At least 1 H2 | Primary keyword included |
| Density | 1-2% (natural, not stuffed) |

---

## 10. Heading Structure Rules

### Hierarchy

| Level | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| **H1** | Title ONLY (set via frontmatter) - NEVER in body |
| **H2** | Major sections |
| **H3** | Subsections under H2 |
| **H4** | Rarely used - only for complex nested content |

### Rules

- **NEVER** skip levels (H2 → H4 is WRONG, must be H2 → H3 → H4)
- **NEVER** use H1 in body content
- Include primary keyword in at least one H2
- Use descriptive, specific heading text

### Valid vs Invalid

```markdown
## Section                    ✅ Valid
### Subsection                ✅ Valid
#### Detail                   ✅ Valid

# Title in Body               ❌ INVALID (H1 in body)
## Section → #### Detail      ❌ INVALID (skipped H3)
```

---

## 11. Featured Image Requirements

### When This Applies

**EVERY blog post** should have a featured image (Open Graph image) for social sharing.

### Technical Specifications

| Property | Requirement | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| **Dimensions** | Exactly 1200×630 pixels | Open Graph standard |
| **Aspect Ratio** | 1.91:1 | Optimal for all social platforms |
| **Format** | WebP (or JPG/PNG if WebP not supported) | Best balance of quality and size |
| **Quality** | 80-85% | Balance between quality and file size |
| **Max File Size** | <100KB | Fast page load, passing Core Web Vitals |
| **Target File Size** | <50KB | Optimal performance |

### Design Guidelines

**Customize these for your brand:**

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Color Scheme** | Use your brand colors consistently |
| **Brand Elements** | Include logo or brand mark |
| **Typography** | Use brand fonts, ensure readability |
| **Visual Style** | Match your overall brand aesthetic |
| **Watermark** | Optional: Add your website URL or logo |

### Safe Zone Layout

**Critical:** Keep all important content in the **middle 50%** of the image.

```
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|              TOP 25% (157.5px)                           |
|              Background/decorative only                   |
|              (May be cropped on some platforms)           |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                          |
|              MIDDLE 50% (315px) ← SAFE ZONE              |
|              ┌────────────────────────────────┐          |
|              │     POST TITLE HERE            │          |
|              │     (Readable, Centered)       │          |
|              │                                │          |
|              │     [Brand element/logo]       │          |
|              └────────────────────────────────┘          |
|                                                          |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|              BOTTOM 25% (157.5px)                        |
|              Background/decorative                       |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Frontmatter Integration

The blog post frontmatter should include:

```yaml
---
heroImage: "/images/featured/[slug].webp"
# OR your custom path structure
featuredImage: "/assets/blog/[slug].webp"
---
```

### File Location

Organize consistently. Example structure:

| File Type | Path |
|-----------|------|
| **Image file** | `public/images/featured/[slug].webp` |
| **Blog post** | `src/content/blog/[slug].md` |

**⚠️ IMPORTANT - No Years in Filenames:**

Never include years in the `[slug]` portion of filenames:

| ❌ BAD | ✅ GOOD |
|--------|----------|
| `marketing-tips-2026.webp` | `marketing-tips.webp` |
| `seo-guide-2026.webp` | `seo-guide.webp` |

This ensures consistency with evergreen URL slugs and prevents images from appearing dated.
