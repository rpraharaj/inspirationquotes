## 6. Unique Angle & Voice Strategy

### 6.1 Content Differentiation

**Differentiation:** This guide focuses on **highest-quality, production-ready prompts** organized by the actual PM workflow from discovery to launch, with specific customization tips and real before/after examples.

**Key Value Proposition:** Unlike competitors offering generic prompt lists, this post provides:
- **30 meticulously crafted prompts** (not 50+ mediocre ones)
- **Organized by PM lifecycle stages** (not random categories)
- **Customization framework** for each prompt
- **Real PM workflow examples** showing prompts in action
- **Quality over quantity** - each prompt is battle-tested and copy-paste ready
- **2026-current AI model references** (GPT-5, Claude 4, Gemini 3)

### 6.2 Human Voice Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Voice Tone:** Experienced PM talking to fellow PMs - practical, honest, conversational, with a touch of humor

**Perspective:** First-person from a seasoned PM who's actually used these prompts in real product work

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Feature prioritization | "I've sat through countless roadmap debates where AI helped cut through the noise" |
| Customer feedback synthesis | "After manually reading 500+ user comments, I learned AI can do this in minutes—wish I'd known sooner" |
| Competitive analysis | "I used to spend 3 hours on competitive research; now it's 30 minutes with the right prompts" |
| PRD writing | "The first AI-generated PRD I got was terrible. Here's what I learned about prompting for better results" |
| Stakeholder updates | "Nothing worse than spending 2 hours crafting the 'perfect' update email. These prompts fixed that" |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| AI replacing PMs | "Hot take: AI won't replace PMs, but PMs who use AI will replace those who don't" |
| Prompt quality | "Most AI prompt lists are garbage—here's why 30 great prompts beat 100 mediocre ones" |
| Tools vs. skills | "Don't get caught up in which AI tool—prompt engineering skill matters more than the platform" |
| Data overload | "AI can analyze data faster, but it can't tell you which data actually matters—that's still on you" |
| Strategy vs. execution | "Use AI for the 'how,' but never outsource the 'why' to a machine" |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- "AI models improve monthly—some prompts that work amazingly today might need tweaking in 3 months"
- "I'm still figuring out the best balance between AI-generated content and human refinement"
- "There's no consensus yet on whether PMs should share AI-generated insights with stakeholders as-is or polish them first"

### 6.3 E-E-A-T Demonstration

| E-E-A-T Signal | How We'll Demonstrate |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Experience** | Real PM workflow examples, before/after comparisons, personal anecdotes about using these prompts |
| **Expertise** | Deep understanding of PM frameworks (RICE, Jobs-to-be-Done), strategic thinking demonstrated in prompt design |
| **Authoritativeness** | Citations from Gartner, product management thought leaders, current AI model documentation |
| **Trustworthiness** | Honest about limitations, admits when AI fails, provides balanced perspective on when NOT to use prompts |
