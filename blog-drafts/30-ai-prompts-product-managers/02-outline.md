5. **Chain prompts for complex tasks:** Break big jobs into prompt sequences

**Admission of uncertainty:** "I'm still figuring out the best balance between AI-generated insights and human refinement"

### H2: Frequently Asked Questions
**Words:** 500
**Goal:** Capture PAA traffic, address common concerns

**Questions (7 total):**

#### FAQ 1: Will AI replace product managers?
**Answer:** No—AI augments PMs by automating data analysis and documentation, but strategic thinking, stakeholder management, customer empathy, and cross-functional leadership remain human skills. PMs who use AI will replace PMs who don't.

####FAQ 2: What's the best AI tool for product managers?
**Answer:** ChatGPT (GPT-5) and Claude 4 Opus are the most versatile for prompting. Specialized tools like Productboard AI and ChatPRD offer PM-specific features. Start with ChatGPT Plus—covers 90% of PM use cases.

#### FAQ 3: How do I write better AI prompts for product management?
**Answer:** Provide context (your role, product stage), specify desired output format, include examples, and iterate. The "context sandwich" works best: role + goal + constraints. Save your best prompts for reuse.

#### FAQ 4: Can AI help with feature prioritization?
**Answer:** Yes—AI can apply frameworks like RICE, ICE, or MoSCoW to feature lists, perform tradeoff analysis, and generate roadmap scenarios. You provide the context (business goals, constraints), AI does the scoring calculations.

#### FAQ 5: Are AI-generated PRDs good enough to use as-is?
**Answer:** No—treat AI output as a first draft. AI can structure PRDs and suggest acceptance criteria, but YOU must validate technical accuracy, add strategic context, and ensure stakeholder alignment. (From experience: I've never shipped an AI PRD without editing.)

#### FAQ 6: How much time can AI prompts save product managers?
**Answer:** Studies show 25-30% efficiency improvement (BuildBetter.ai). In practice, I've seen 8-10 hours/week saved on documentation, feedback synthesis, and competitive research. Results vary by how well you craft prompts.

#### FAQ 7: What are the limitations of AI for product management?
**Answer:** AI can't: make strategic decisions, understand deep customer emotions, create breakthrough innovations, manage stakeholder politics, or make ethical product choices. Use AI for analysis and automation, but keep humans in charge of "why" and "should we."
