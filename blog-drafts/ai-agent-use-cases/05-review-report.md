## Reviewer Notes

This draft was exceptionally well-written from the start. The personal voice is authentic, the examples are specific and verifiable, and the structure flows naturally. The only minor note is that the uncertainty admission could be slightly expanded, but the current level (score 11/12) exceeds the minimum threshold.

The article provides genuine value by going beyond generic descriptions to cite specific companies with specific metrics. This differentiates it from competing content that often lacks concrete evidence.
