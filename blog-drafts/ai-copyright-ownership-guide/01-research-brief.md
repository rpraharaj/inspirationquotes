**Key Value Proposition:** Clear, updated information on what you can and can't protect, with real examples and practical steps—written by someone who actually uses these tools.

### 6.2 Human Voice Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Voice Tone:** Professional but accessible—like a friend who happens to be a copyright lawyer
**Perspective:** Generic first-person ("I've spent hours researching this...", "In my experience...")

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| Using AI tools | Share personal experience creating with AI and wondering about rights |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| Future of AI copyright | The law will eventually catch up—it's going to take a few more landmark cases |

| Practical approach | Don't let copyright fear paralyze you, but document your creative process |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- The legal landscape is genuinely evolving—there's no single "right answer" yet
- Different countries have different approaches, creating a patchwork of rules
- Key court decisions expected in 2026 may change everything
