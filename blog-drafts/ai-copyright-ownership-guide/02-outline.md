## 📝 Content Structure

### Hook/Opening (150-200 words)
**Approach:** Personal anecdote about creating something with AI and wondering "wait, do I actually own this?"

**Key elements:**
- Start with relatable scenario (generated an image, wrote content with AI)
- Immediate hook: "The answer isn't as simple as you think—and some recent court cases just made it more complicated"
- Establish stakes: Why this matters for anyone creating content
- Transition to what we'll cover

**Featured Snippet Target (paragraph):**
"You cannot copyright purely AI-generated content in the United States—the U.S. Copyright Office requires human authorship as a 'bedrock requirement.' However, if you provide substantial creative input that shapes the final work, those human-authored elements may be eligible for protection."
