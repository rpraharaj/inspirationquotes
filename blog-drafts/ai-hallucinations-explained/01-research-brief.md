## 4. Key Causes of AI Hallucinations

1. **Data-driven issues**: Incomplete, biased, outdated training data
2. **Statistical prediction**: LLMs predict probable words, not factual truth
3. **No true/false labels**: Pre-training doesn't teach models to verify facts
4. **Prompt ambiguity**: Vague prompts lead to creative interpretation
5. **Overconfidence**: Models generate plausible-sounding content without verification
6. **Cascading errors**: Longer responses compound potential inaccuracies

## 5. Famous Examples

1. **Lawyer citing fake cases** - NY lawyer submitted ChatGPT-fabricated legal citations, got sanctioned
2. **Google Bard JWST error** - Incorrectly claimed JWST took first exoplanet images
3. **Microsoft Sydney** - Made bizarre claims including falling in love with users
4. **Meta Galactica** - Withdrawn for inaccurate and prejudiced information
5. **Air Canada chatbot** - Cited non-existent company policy, led to lawsuit
6. **Incorrect medication dosage** - LLM provided dangerous ibuprofen dosage for child
7. **Pennsylvania court cases (2026)** - Judges identifying suspected AI hallucinations in legal briefs

---

## 6. Prevention Strategies

1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** - External verified knowledge
2. **Chain-of-thought prompting** - Step-by-step reasoning (35% accuracy improvement)
3. **Explicit uncertainty instructions** - 52% hallucination reduction
4. **Knowledge cutoff specification** - 89% reduction in fake recent info
5. **Human-in-the-loop** - 76% of enterprises now use this
6. **Temperature control** - Lower settings for more deterministic outputs
7. **Fine-tuning** - Domain-specific training for specialized accuracy

## 8. Human Voice Strategy

**Voice Tone:** Honest, relatable, slightly frustrated with the problem
**Perspective:** Someone who's been burned by AI inaccuracies firsthand

**Personal Experience Opportunities:**
- Time when AI confidently gave wrong information
- Embarrassment of sharing AI-generated "facts" that were wrong
- Learning to verify AI outputs the hard way

**Opinion/Hot Take:**
- Hallucinations are not a bug that will be fixed—they're inherent to how LLMs work
- The real solution is changing how we think about AI: assistant, not oracle
