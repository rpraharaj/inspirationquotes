## 6. Unique Angle & Voice Strategy

### 6.1 Content Differentiation

**Differentiation:** This post focuses on building a COMPLETE, INTEGRATED AI marketing stack rather than just listing random tools—showing how tools work together across 7 key marketing functions.

**Key Value Proposition:** Readers will get a categorized, stack-building framework they can immediately implement, with specific tool recommendations for each marketing function regardless of budget.

### 6.2 Human Voice Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Voice Tone:** Professional but warm, conversational
**Perspective:** Generic first-person ("I've tested...", "In my experience...")

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Tool overwhelm | The feeling of drowning in too many AI tools |
| Integration challenges | When tools don't talk to each other |
| ROI realization | The moment AI tools actually started paying off |
| Tool fatigue | Subscribing to tools and never using them |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| Tool selection | You don't need 20 AI tools—you need the right 5-7 |
| Free vs paid | Free tiers are often enough for small businesses |
| Integration | The best tool is useless if it creates data silos |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- AI tool landscape changes rapidly—today's winner might be tomorrow's has-been
- What works for one business might not work for another
- ROI can be hard to measure precisely

### 6.3 E-E-A-T Demonstration

| E-E-A-T Signal | How We'll Demonstrate |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Experience** | First-person observations about testing tools |
| **Expertise** | Technical accuracy, specific feature comparisons |
| **Authoritativeness** | Citing official pricing, linking to product docs |
| **Trustworthiness** | Balanced pros/cons, admitting limitations |
