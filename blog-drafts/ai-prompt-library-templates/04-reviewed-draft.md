I keep a personal collection of prompts that I've refined over months of daily AI use. Every time I find one that works really well, I save it. This article is that collection—organized, explained, and ready for you to copy.

These prompts work with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and most other AI assistants. Some are simple one-liners. Others are structured templates with placeholders you'll fill in. All of them have been tested and produce consistently good results.

Here's how to use this library: Find a category relevant to your task, pick a prompt, customize it with your specifics, and use it. That's it. No need to read everything—jump to what you need.

If you want to understand why these prompts work and how to write your own, check out our [prompt engineering guide](/blog/prompt-engineering-beginners-guide). But if you just want prompts that work right now, keep scrolling.

Let's dive into 200+ ready-to-use AI prompts.
