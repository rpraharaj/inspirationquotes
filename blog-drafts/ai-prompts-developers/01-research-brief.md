## 6. Unique Angle \u0026 Voice Strategy

### 6.1 Content Differentiation

**Differentiation:** A practical, workflow-organized guide to AI prompts for developers in 2026, categorized by actual development tasks (not generic prompt types), with before/after examples, real code snippets, and honest discussion of AI limitations.

**Key Value Proposition:** Unlike scattered prompt lists, this guide organizes 50+ prompts by developer workflow phases, includes copy-paste templates, demonstrates real productivity gains, and addresses when NOT to use AI.

### 6.2 Human Voice Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Voice Tone:** Professional but conversational, like a senior developer sharing battle-tested techniques with teammates over coffee.

**Perspective:** First-person plural ("we," "I've found," "in my experience")

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| AI debugging | "I spent 2 hours debugging a TypeError last week, then asked Claude to analyze it—found the issue in 30 seconds." |
| Code review prompts | "My team started using AI for initial code reviews, and honestly, it catches things we miss when we're rushing." |
| Limitations | "I tried generating an entire feature with AI once. Never again. The debugging took longer than writing it myself." |
| Best practices | "The trick I've learned: be annoyingly specific in your prompts. 'Debug this' gets you nowhere. 'Debug this TypeError in line 42 when integrating Strapi 5, here's the stack trace' works magic." |
| Model evolution | "Remember when we were all using GPT-4 last year? Claude 4 Opus and GPT-5 have completely changed the game for code generation." |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| AI replacing developers | "AI won't replace developers, but developers who use AI will replace those who don't. Hot take? Maybe. True? Absolutely." |
| Over-reliance on AI | "I've seen junior devs copy-paste AI code without understanding it. That's not using AI—that's outsourcing your learning." |
| Best AI for coding | "GitHub Copilot is great for autocomplete, but for complex debugging? Claude 4 Opus wins. Fight me." |
| Future of coding | "In 2026, the best developers aren't the fastest coders—they're the best prompt engineers and code reviewers." |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- "I'm still figuring out the best prompts for architecture design—sometimes AI suggestions are brilliant, sometimes they're wildly impractical."
- "The line between helpful AI assistance and over-reliance is blurry. I don't have a perfect answer, but here's what I've learned..."
- "Will AI-generated code introduce more security vulnerabilities? Gartner says yes (2500% more defects by 2028), but I think it depends on how we use it."

### 6.3 E-E-A-T Demonstration

| E-E-A-T Signal | How We'll Demonstrate |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Experience** | First-person stories of using AI in real development workflows, specific time savings, failures and lessons learned |
| **Expertise** | Technical accuracy, detailed prompt structures, understanding of when AI fails, current model capabilities (GPT-5, Claude 4, Gemini 3) |
| **Authoritativeness** | Citing Gartner/McKinsey data, referencing official OpenAI/Anthropic docs, linking to Stack Overflow surveys |
| **Trustworthiness** | Honest about AI limitations, admitting uncertainty, balanced perspective (not all hype), warning about security risks |
