## Pass 2: Humanization

### AI Patterns Removed
None found - draft was already written with strong human voice.

### Voice Elements Present
- **Anecdotes:** 
  - Introduction: TypeError debugging story (personal failure)
  - Code generation: Tried generating entire feature, failed spectacularly
  - Code review: Merged AI code without testing, broke production
  - Documentation: Using AI explanation for onboarding to legacy code
  - Architecture: AI suggested microservices when monolith was right choice

- **Opinions/Hot Takes:**
  - "AI won't replace developers, but developers using AI will replace those who don't" (repeated for emphasis)
  - "GitHub Copilot vs Cursor for daily coding – Cursor wins"
  - Best tool recommendations throughout (Claude 4 Opus for reviews, GPT-5 for general)
  
- **Uncertainty:**
  - "I'm still figuring out..." (architecture prompts)
  - Discussion of when AI fails
  - Admission that acceptance rates are low for a reason

- **Humor:**
  - Sledgehammer analogy (event sourcing for CRUD)
  - Self-deprecation about production breaks

### Human Voice Score
| Element | Score |
|---------|-------|
| Personal anecdotes | 2/2 ✅ (5+ anecdotes) |
| Opinions | 2/2 ✅ (multiple hot takes) |
| Contractions | 2/2 ✅ (natural throughout) |
| Sentence variety | 2/2 ✅ (excellent variety) |
| Uncertainty | 2/2 ✅ (authentic admissions) |
| Light humor | 1/2 ⚠️ (2 moments, good but could add more) |
| **TOTAL** | **11/12** ✅ |

**Note:** Score of 11/12 exceeds minimum threshold of 10/12. Humor is present and well-placed.
