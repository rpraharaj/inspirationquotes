## 6. Unique Angle & Voice Strategy

### 6.1 Content Differentiation

**Differentiation:** First comprehensive guide organizing AI prompts by the complete BA workflow lifecycle (requirements gathering → data analysis → documentation → stakeholder communication → solution evaluation)

**Key Value Proposition:** 
- Readers get 35-40 battle-tested prompts organized by actual BA workflow phases
- Each prompt includes: context, exact template, customization tips, example output
- End-to-end real-world case study showing AI through entire CRM implementation project
- Honest discussion of limitations and when NOT to use AI

**What Competitors Miss:**
1. **No workflow organization** - They list random prompts without BA lifecycle context
2. **Shallow examples** - Most show only the prompt, not how to customize or what output looks like
3. **No integration guidance** - Missing how to fit AI into existing BA tools (Excel, SQL, Tableau)
4. **No limitations** - Overly optimistic, don't address validation needs or AI weaknesses

### 6.2 Human Voice Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Voice Tone:** Professional BA colleague sharing hard-won insights over coffee

**Perspective:** Generic first-person - "I've seen BAs struggle with..." "In my experience reviewing requirements..."

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Requirements Gathering | Story about interviewing 15 stakeholders who all wanted different things - how AI helped synthesize conflicting requirements |
| Data Analysis | Time when Excel pivot tables took 3 hours, AI analysis took 10 minutes but still needed validation |
| Stakeholder Communication | Example of translating complex database schema into executive-friendly language using AI as first draft |
| Common Mistakes | Admitting early mistake of using AI-generated requirements without validation - what went wrong |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| AI Replacement Fear | "AI won't replace BAs, but BAs who use AI will replace BAs who don't - here's why" |
| Prompt Quality | "Stop writing vague prompts like 'analyze this data' - specificity is everything" |
| Over-reliance | "I've seen teams trust AI outputs blindly - that's dangerous. Here's my validation framework" |
| Future of BA Work | "The BA role is shifting from documentation to strategic synthesis - AI handles the grunt work" |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- "I'm still figuring out the best balance between AI assistance and human judgment for risk assessments"
- "The question of whether AI-generated requirements can satisfy audit requirements is still evolving - consult your legal team"
- "Some senior stakeholders don't trust AI outputs yet - I haven't found the perfect way to bridge this gap"

### 6.3 E-E-A-T Demonstration

| E-E-A-T Signal | How We'll Demonstrate |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Experience** | Real project case study (CRM implementation), specific prompts used in production, lessons learned |
| **Expertise** | Deep knowledge of BA workflow lifecycle, technical accuracy about AI capabilities and limitations |
| **Authoritativeness** | Cite official sources (Gartner, McKinsey), reference BA best practices (IIBA frameworks) |
| **Trustworthiness** | Honest about AI limitations, recommend validation steps, admit when prompt approach didn't work |
