## Pass 4: External Links Assessment

### External Links Present

| Anchor Text | URL | Context | Quality |
|-------------|-----|---------|---------|
| McKinsey's 2025 AI report | https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai | Statistics on AI adoption | ✅ Authoritative |
| Gartner predicts | https://www.gartner.com/en | AI agents forecast | ✅ Authoritative |
| (Implied IIBA reference) | Referenced but no direct link in Best AI Tools section | BA standards | Note: Could add explicit link |

### Link Quality Assessment

- ✅ All links are to authoritative sources (.com reputable research firms)
- ✅ Links are contextually relevant to claims

**Optional improvement:** Add explicit link to IIBA (International Institute of Business Analysis) when mentioning BABOK standards in the "Why Business Analysts Need Workflow-Specific Prompts" section.

**Current text:**
> "BA work isn't just 'analyze data' or 'write a document.' You're synthesizing stakeholder input, following established methodologies (BABOK, Agile)..."

**Enhanced version:**
> "BA work isn't just 'analyze data' or 'write a document.' You're synthesizing stakeholder input, following established methodologies ([BABOK](https://www.iiba.org/business-analysis-body-of-knowledge/), Agile)..."

This would bring total external links to 4, all highly authoritative.
