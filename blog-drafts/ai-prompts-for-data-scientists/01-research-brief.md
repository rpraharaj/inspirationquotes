## 7. Unique Angle & Voice Strategy

### 7.1 Content Differentiation

**Differentiation:** Position as the most comprehensive, workflow-oriented guide for data scientists using AI prompts - organized by actual DS workflow stages (not just random prompt collections), with real code examples and validation guidance.

**Key Value Proposition:** Unlike generic "ChatGPT prompts" lists, this guide maps prompts directly to the data science workflow (explore → clean → analyze → model → visualize → communicate), includes end-to-end project examples with actual Python code, and provides critical guidance on when NOT to trust AI output.

### 7.2 Human Voice Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Voice Tone:** Professional data scientist sharing battle-tested prompts with peers - conversational but technically credible
**Perspective:** First-person (data scientist who has tested these prompts in production)

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| Data cleaning prompts | "I've spent hours manually cleaning messy datasets - here's how AI cut that time by 70%" |
| Model validation | "I once deployed an AI-suggested model without validation. Big mistake. Here's what I learned..." |
| Code review | "AI caught a subtle pandas indexing bug that would have corrupted my analysis" |
| Statistical tests | "AI helped me remember which test to use when I was brain-fogged at 11 PM" |
| Visualization choices | "Sometimes AI suggests visualizations I wouldn't have considered - and they're perfect" |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| AI replacing data scientists | "AI won't replace data scientists, but data scientists who use AI will replace those who don't" |
| Prompt engineering as a skill | "Writing good prompts for data science is becoming as important as knowing SQL" |
| Over-reliance on AI | "If you can't explain why the AI suggested that model, don't use it in production" |
| Future of data science | "In 2026, AI is my junior analyst - I still make the final calls" |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- "I'm still experimenting with the best prompts for time series forecasting - it's hit or miss"
- "Honestly, some statistical concepts are so nuanced that AI explanations can be misleading"
- "I don't fully understand how GPT-5 reasons about data - I just know what works in practice"

### 7.3 E-E-A-T Demonstration

| E-E-A-T Signal | How We'll Demonstrate |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Experience** | Share specific project examples (customer churn, sales forecasting), actual code tested in Jupyter, mistakes made and lessons learned |
| **Expertise** | Technical accuracy in statistical concepts, proper use of ML terminology, code that actually runs, understanding of when AI fails |
| **Authoritativeness** | Link to official docs (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib), cite Gartner/McKinsey research, reference current AI model capabilities |
| **Trustworthiness** | Admit AI limitations, warn against blindly trusting AI output, provide validation strategies, acknowledge uncertainty |

## 10. Competitor Content Gaps (Our Opportunities)

1. **Workflow Integration:** Competitors list prompts randomly - we organize by actual DS workflow stages
2. **Validation Guidance:** No one explains how to verify AI-suggested models/code - critical gap
3. **When NOT to Use AI:** Competitors oversell AI - we provide honest limitations
4. **End-to-End Examples:** Most show isolated prompts - we show complete project workflow
5. **Current AI Models:** Competitors reference outdated models (GPT-4, Claude 3) - we use 2026 models
6. **Code That Runs:** Many show pseudocode - we provide actual tested Python snippets
7. **Ethical Considerations:** Rarely discussed - important for professional data scientists
8. **Technical Integration:** Missing guidance on Jupyter, VS Code, data science tools integration
