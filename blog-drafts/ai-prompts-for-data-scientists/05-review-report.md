- **Anecdote 6:** Feature Engineering - "RFM score boosted AUC from 0.76 to 0.83"
- **Opinion 1:** "AI won't replace data scientists, but data scientists who use AI will replace those who don't"
- **Opinion 2:** "If you can't explain why AI suggested that model, don't use it in production"
- **Opinion 3:** "Data scientists who can communicate will outlast those who can't"
- **Uncertainty 1:** "I'm still experimenting with prompts for time series forecasting"
- **Uncertainty 2:** "I don't fully understand how GPT-5 reasons about data"
- **Humor:** Self-deprecating moment about deploying AI code without review ("Bad move")

### Human Voice Score

| Element | Score |
|---------|-------|
