## 7. Unique Angle & Voice Strategy

### 7.1 Content Differentiation

**Differentiation:** The only guide organized by the **complete project management workflow** (Initiate → Plan → Execute → Monitor → Close) with Agile/Scrum-specific variations. Unlike competitors who provide random prompt lists, we map prompts to actual PM daily workflows.

**Key Value Proposition:**
- **Workflow-based organization** instead of random lists
- **Before/After examples** showing vague vs. optimized prompts
- **Methodology-specific guidance** (Agile vs. Traditional)
- **Prompt customization framework** - teach PMs to adapt prompts
- **Real PM scenarios** - Sprint planning, risk registers, stakeholder updates
- **AI tool comparison** - Which prompts work best on ChatGPT vs. Claude vs. Gemini

**Why This Works:** Project managers think in workflows and methodologies, not random tasks. Organizing by actual PM processes makes content immediately actionable.

**E-E-A-T Signal:** Real-world PM experience shown through specific scenarios like "midproject scope creep" or "sprint retrospective facilitation"

### 7.2 Human Voice Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Voice Tone:** Experienced PM sharing hard-won insights; pragmatic, not theoretical

**Perspective:** First-person plural ("we've all been there..."), occasional first-person singular for specific examples

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Sprint Planning | "I spent 3 hours manually creating sprint plans until I discovered this prompt pattern..." |
| Risk Management | "In 2025, I watched a project nearly fail because the AI risk assessment missed human factors. Here's what I learned..." |
| Stakeholder Communication | "The worst stakeholder update I ever sent was AI-generated without context. Here's how to avoid that mistake..." |
| Tool Selection | "I've tested every major AI tool for PM work. Here's what actually works in the real world..." |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| AI Replacing PMs | "NO. AI won't replace you, but PMs who use AI will replace those who don't. Here's why..." |
| Mega-Prompts | "Everyone loves 'mega-prompts' but they're often impractical. Here's a simpler approach..." |
| AI Trust | "If you're blindly trusting AI outputs, you're doing PM wrong. Validation is non-negotiable." |
| Agile AI | "AI is terrible at understanding team dynamics. Don't use it for everything..." |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- "I'm still figuring out the best way to use AI for retrospectives - it lacks emotional intelligence"
- "The jury's still out on whether AI can truly understand project risk context"
- "I don't have all the answers on which AI tool is 'best' - it depends on your methodology"

### 7.3 E-E-A-T Demonstration

| E-E-A-T Signal | How We'll Demonstrate |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Experience** | Real scenarios: sprint planning gone wrong, scope creep handling, stakeholder pushback |
| **Expertise** | Deep PM knowledge: WBS, RACI, burn-down charts, velocity tracking |
| **Authoritativeness** | Cite PMI, Gartner, McKinsey data; reference PM frameworks (PMBOK, Agile Manifesto) |
| **Trustworthiness** | Balanced perspective: acknowledge AI limitations, warn against over-reliance |

## 10. Competitor Content Gaps (Our Opportunities)

### What Competitors Miss:

1. **No methodology-specific guidance** - All treat PM as monolithic; we differentiate Agile/Scrum/Waterfall
2. **Random prompt organization** - Lists are unstructured; we organize by PM workflow phases
3. **No prompt quality education** - They give prompts but don't teach WHY they work
4. **Missing AI tool comparison** - Don't explain which prompts work better on specific platforms
5. **Lack of real-world context** - Generic examples; we use actual PM pain points
6. **No validation guidance** - Don't teach how to verify AI outputs
7. **Outdated AI model references** - Some still mention GPT-4; we use 2026 models
8. **Missing human voice** - Corporate/robotic tone; we add personality and experience
