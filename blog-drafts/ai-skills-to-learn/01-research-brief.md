## 5. Unique Angle

**Thesis:** The most valuable AI skills in 2026 combine technical proficiency with human judgment. Pure technical skills are necessary but not sufficient—the differentiator is combining AI fluency with critical thinking, ethics, and domain expertise.

**Key Messages:**
1. AI skills aren't just for engineers anymore—they're table stakes for ALL knowledge workers
2. The 56% salary premium proves AI literacy pays off immediately
3. Human-centric skills (judgment, verification, ethics) are just as important as coding
4. You don't need a CS degree—skills matter more than credentials (per PwC research)
5. Start with the fundamentals (Python, prompt engineering) before jumping to advanced ML
