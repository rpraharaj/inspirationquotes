## Human Voice Plan

### Opening
- Hook type: Personal observation + excitement/overwhelm
- Specific idea: "I've been covering AI for years, but nothing prepared me for the pace of 2026. It's only January 8th, and my notes already look like they're from an entire year of announcements."

### Personal Experiences to Include
1. Location: GPT-5 section - Topic: "The first time I tested GPT-5, I genuinely wasn't sure if I was being fooled by a human"
2. Location: CES 2026 section - Topic: "Watching the Boston Dynamics demo gave me genuine goosebumps—and I'm usually skeptical of robot hype"
3. Location: Sora 2 section - Topic: "I spent way too many hours generating ridiculous videos last month"

### Opinion/Hot Take
- Location: Agentic AI section
- Take: "Let's be real—Gartner's prediction of 40% of enterprise apps embedding AI agents by year-end feels wildly optimistic to me. But I've been wrong before."

### Uncertainty Admission
- Location: What's Next section
- Phrasing: "Honestly? Anyone who claims to know exactly where this is heading in the next 6 months is either lying or selling something."

### Humor/Wit Opportunities
- Location: Model releases overview
- Idea: "Keeping track of model version numbers now requires its own spreadsheet. Actually, I made one. It's already outdated."
