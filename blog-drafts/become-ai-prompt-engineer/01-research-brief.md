## 6. Unique Angle & Voice Strategy

### 6.1 Content Differentiation

**Differentiation:** The only guide with a specific 12-month roadmap broken into phases with milestones, plus honest assessment of whether prompt engineering will remain a standalone role vs. becoming a core skill

**Key Value Proposition:** Actionable month-by-month roadmap with specific resources, portfolio project ideas, and salary negotiation tips - not just theory

### 6.2 Human Voice Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Voice Tone:** Encouraging mentor, realistic about challenges, career-advice style
**Perspective:** Generic first-person ("I've seen many career changers...", "In my experience coaching...")

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Career transition | Observations about how quickly people pick up prompt engineering |
| Skill development | What skills actually matter vs. what's overhyped |
| Job market reality | Honest take on "prompt engineer" as job title vs. integrated skill |
| Portfolio building | What hiring managers actually look for |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| "Prompt Engineer" title | The title matters less than the skill - it's becoming embedded everywhere |
| Coding requirement | Basic Python is increasingly important, don't skip it |
| Certifications | Most aren't worth it yet, but that's changing in 2026 |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- Whether "Prompt Engineer" remains a standalone title or gets absorbed into other roles
- How quickly AI will automate basic prompting (it probably won't eliminate the need for experts)
- Which certifications will become industry standards

### 6.3 E-E-A-T Demonstration

| E-E-A-T Signal | How We'll Demonstrate |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Experience** | Career transition stories, real portfolio examples, practical advice |
| **Expertise** | Technical depth on prompting techniques, current model knowledge |
| **Authoritativeness** | Citing official sources (OpenAI, Anthropic, industry reports) |
| **Trustworthiness** | Honest salary expectations, acknowledging uncertainty in job market |
