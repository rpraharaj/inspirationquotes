## 4. Unique Angle

**Thesis:** Not all AI certifications are equal. Some are resume padding, others are genuine career accelerators. Focus on certifications that:
1. Are recognized by employers (cloud provider certs)
2. Teach practical, job-ready skills (project-based)
3. Align with where demand is growing (GenAI, MLOps)

**Key Messages:**
1. Cloud certifications (Google, AWS, Azure) offer biggest proven ROI
2. Don't waste money on "certificate mills" with no industry recognition
3. Free/low-cost options (IBM via Coursera) can be just as valuable for beginners
4. Stack certifications strategically rather than collecting random ones
5. Pair certifications with hands-on projects for maximum impact
