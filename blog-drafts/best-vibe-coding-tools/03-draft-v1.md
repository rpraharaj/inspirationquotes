## 1. Cursor AI — Best for Professional Developers

**Website:** [cursor.com](https://cursor.com)

If you're a professional developer who wants to supercharge your existing workflow with AI, Cursor is probably your best bet. It's essentially VS Code rebuilt from the ground up with AI at its core.

### What Makes Cursor Special

Unlike simpler AI tools that only see your current file, Cursor understands your entire codebase. When you ask it to implement a feature, it considers your project structure, existing patterns, and dependencies. The suggestions feel remarkably context-aware.

**Key features:**
- **Full codebase awareness** — References your entire project for suggestions
- **Integrated AI chat** — Ask questions and get help without leaving the editor
- **Proprietary AI model** — Optimized specifically for programming tasks
- **Tab completion on steroids** — Predictive completions that understand context
- **VS Code compatibility** — Your existing extensions and settings work

### Real-World Experience

In my testing, Cursor shined when working on complex projects. I could ask it to "add authentication to the user API" and it would generate code that matched my existing patterns, included proper error handling, and even updated related files.

The learning curve is minimal if you already use VS Code. The main adjustment is learning to "converse" with your editor—describing what you want rather than typing every line.

### Pricing
- **Free tier:** Limited AI queries
- **Pro:** $20/month with unlimited queries
- **Business:** $40/month with team features

### Best For
Professional developers working on complex, multi-file projects who want AI that truly understands their codebase.

When you [compare AI coding tools](/blog/copilot-vs-cursor-vs-cody), Cursor consistently wins on contextual understanding—it's not just completing lines, it's understanding intent.

## 2. Bolt.new — Best for Rapid MVPs

**Website:** [bolt.new](https://bolt.new)

If you need to go from idea to deployed application as fast as humanly possible, Bolt.new is almost magical. It's built by StackBlitz, and it generates full-stack applications from natural language prompts.

### What Makes Bolt.new Special

Bolt.new doesn't just write code—it creates entire project structures. Describe your app, and within seconds you have a running preview with frontend, backend, and database logic in place. It's the closest thing to "instant app creation" I've seen.

**Key features:**
- **Full-stack generation** — Frontend, backend, and database from one prompt
- **Instant preview** — See your app running immediately
- **Deployment built-in** — Ship to production without leaving the tool
- **Service integrations** — Pre-built connections to Stripe, Supabase, auth providers
- **Iterative refinement** — Keep chatting to modify and improve

### Real-World Experience

I tested Bolt.new by describing "a SaaS landing page with pricing tiers, email capture, and a demo scheduling button." In under a minute, I had a polished, deployed landing page that would typically take hours to build manually.

The limitations appear when you need precise control or unusual patterns. Bolt works best when you're building something that fits common templates—landing pages, dashboards, CRUD apps, portfolios.

### Pricing
- **Free tier:** Limited usage
- **Pro:** ~$20/month for more usage
- **Team plans available**

### Best For
