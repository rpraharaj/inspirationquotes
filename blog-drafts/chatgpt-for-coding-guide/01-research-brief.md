---

## 5. Unique Angle

**"The Working Developer's Reality Check"**

While most content is either overly promotional ("10x your productivity!") or doom-and-gloom ("AI will replace you!"), this guide takes a **practical, balanced approach**:

- What actually works in real development workflows
- Where ChatGPT genuinely saves time vs. creates false efficiency
- Honest discussion of limitations and security concerns
- GPT-5-specific capabilities and best practices for 2026
- Concrete prompts that produce reliable results

**Tone:** Experienced developer sharing lessons learned, not marketing material.

## 6. Key Use Cases to Cover

### Core Use Cases
1. **Code Generation** - Writing new functions, components, boilerplate
2. **Debugging & Error Resolution** - Identifying bugs, understanding errors
3. **Code Review & Refactoring** - Improving existing code quality
4. **Documentation** - Comments, READMEs, API docs
5. **Learning & Explanation** - Understanding unfamiliar code/concepts
6. **Unit Test Generation** - Writing tests for existing code
7. **System Architecture** - Design decisions and patterns

### Advanced Use Cases (2026)
8. **Multi-file project understanding** (GPT-5's 400K context)
9. **Agentic workflows** - Autonomous task completion
10. **Code translation** - Porting between languages/frameworks

---

## 7. Best Practices Research

### Effective Prompting for Code
1. **Be specific and provide context** - Include language, framework, constraints
2. **Iterative refinement** - Start simple, build complexity
3. **Ask for explanations** - Understand the "why" not just the "what"
4. **Break down complex tasks** - Smaller chunks = better results
5. **Specify edge cases** - Include handling requirements upfront
6. **Request testing** - Ask for tests alongside code

### Common Pitfalls
1. Accepting code without understanding it
2. Pasting sensitive data into prompts
3. Over-reliance leading to skill erosion
4. Ignoring security vulnerabilities in generated code
5. Using outdated prompting patterns from GPT-4 era

---

## 8. Prompt Templates to Include

### Code Generation Prompt Template
```
Generate a [language] function named [function name] that:
1. Accepts the following parameters: [parameter 1 (type)], [parameter 2 (type)]
2. Performs the following logic: [describe detailed logic]
3. Returns [return type and description]
4. Handles these edge cases: [list edge cases]
5. Follows [coding style/conventions]
```

### Debugging Prompt Template
```
I'm getting an error in my [language] code:

Error message: [paste error]

Code snippet: [paste relevant code]

My goal: [what the code should do]

What I've tried: [list attempted fixes]

Can you explain the error and suggest a fix?
```

### Code Review Prompt Template
```
Review the following [language] code for:
- Potential bugs and logical errors
- Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- Performance issues
- Adherence to [framework/style] best practices
- Code readability and maintainability

Code: [paste code]

The code's purpose: [describe what it does]
```
