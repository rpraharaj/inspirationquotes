## 7. Unique Angle & Voice Strategy

### 7.1 Content Differentiation

**Differentiation:** "Prompts that Actually Work" - Focus on results-driven, tested prompts with customization guidance and real ROI data, not just generic copy-paste lists

**Key Value Proposition:** 
- Only 25 prompts (vs. competitors with 30-50+), but each is battle-tested with specific use cases
- Includes customization templates so prompts work for YOUR brand
- Real campaign results and ROI data attached to each category
- Updated for 2026 AI models (GPT-5, Claude 4, Gemini 3) - competitors still reference GPT-4
- Practical "how to use" context for each prompt, not just the prompt itself

### 7.2 Human Voice Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Voice Tone:** Professional marketer to marketer - conversational, practical, opinionated

**Perspective:** First-person generic ("I've tested...", "In my experience...", "Here's what actually works...")

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| Prompt engineering | Story about getting terrible results from generic prompts, then learning the framework |
| Brand voice consistency | Time when AI-generated content didn' match brand voice - learned to add brand voice guidelines to prompts |
| ROI skepticism | Initially skeptical about AI marketing hype, but shocked when campaign conversion rates jumped 12% |
| Tool selection | Tried 5 different AI tools, here's why we settled on ChatGPT + Claude combo |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| AI content quality | "Most AI marketing content is garbage because people use garbage prompts. The problem isn't is AI - it's lazy prompting." |
| Quantity vs. quality | "Stop collecting 100+ prompts. Master 10 great ones first. Quality > quantity." |
| Model choice | "GPT-5 gets the hype, but Claude 4 Sonnet is actually better for marketing copy in my experience - more natural, less robotic." |
| AI replacing marketers | "AI won't replace marketers. But marketers who use AI will replace those who don't." |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- "I'm still figuring out the best way to maintain brand voice consistently across AI-generated content"
- "The ROI data is compelling, but every brand is different - your mileage may vary"
- "AI models are evolving so fast that prompts that work today might need tweaking in 3 months"
- "I don't have all the answers on AI copyright and legal issues - consult a lawyer for your specific situation"

### 7.3 E-E-A-T Demonstration

| E-E-A-T Signal | How We'll Demonstrate |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Experience** | Share specific campaign results from testing prompts, before/after examples, tools tried, failures and learnings |
| **Expertise** | Demonstrate deep understanding of prompt engineering, marketing frameworks (AIDA, PAS), AI capabilities/limitations |
| **Authoritativeness** | Cite authoritative sources (Gartner, McKinsey), link to official AI documentation (OpenAI, Anthropic), reference 2026 AI models |
| **Trustworthiness** | Admit uncertainties, balanced perspective on AI (not a silver bullet), disclose limitations, provide real data |
