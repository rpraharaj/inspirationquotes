### H2: Frequently Asked Questions
**Words:** 450
**Goal:** Capture PAA traffic and address common concerns

**Questions:**

#### Does AI-generated marketing content hurt SEO?

No, not if it's high-quality. Google's guidelines focus on content quality, not how it's created. The key is to add your expertise, verify facts, and ensure it serves user intent. AI is a tool - like spell check - not a replacement for your marketing knowledge.

#### How do I maintain my brand voice with AI?

Create a system prompt (or custom instructions) that includes your brand voice guidelines. Include examples of your best content and specify what makes your brand unique. I save this as a reusable template so every prompt starts with my brand context.

#### Are there legal/copyright issues with AI-generated marketing content?

This is still evolving. Currently: AI-generated content isn't copyrightable on its own, but content you substantially edit is. Check your AI provider's terms of service. For commercial use, I add my own expertise and editing - the AI is a starting point, not the final product. Consult a lawyer for your specific situation.

#### What's the best way to write a ChatGPT prompt for marketing?

Include 4 elements: (1) Role/context ("You're a B2B SaaS marketer"), (2) Specific task ("Write 5 LinkedIn post variations"), (3) Constraints (word count, tone, format), and (4) Success criteria ("Optimized for engagement, include question hook"). See the "What Makes a Prompt Work" section above for details.

#### Can ChatGPT replace a marketing team?

No. AI is a productivity amplifier, not a replacement. It handles repetitive tasks (variations, first drafts, research) so your team can focus on strategy, creativity, and relationships. Think of it like Excel - it didn't replace accountants, it made them more productive.

#### Which AI model is best for marketing in 2026?

Depends on your use case. I use **Claude 4 Sonnet for most copy** (more natural tone), **GPT-5 for brainstorming** (more creative), and **Gemini 3 Pro for data analysis** (huge context window). See "Platform-Specific Tips" section above for detailed comparison.

#### How do I measure ROI from AI marketing prompts?

Track before/after metrics: email open rates, conversion rates, time saved, cost per acquisition. Example: If AI saves 10 hours/week ($50/hr) and improves conversion rate by 2%, that's $500/week saved + increased revenue. Most teams see positive ROI within 6 months (76% according to research).
