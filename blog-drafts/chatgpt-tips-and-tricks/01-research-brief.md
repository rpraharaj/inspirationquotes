## 7. Unique Angle & Voice Strategy

### 7.1 Content Differentiation

**Differentiation:** Most comprehensive, up-to-date guide covering BOTH basic prompting AND new 2026 features (Memory, Projects, Scheduled Tasks) that competitors miss

**Key Value Proposition:** Learn tips that 95% of ChatGPT users don't know, with actionable examples for each technique

### 7.2 Human Voice Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Voice Tone:** Friendly expert sharing insider knowledge
**Perspective:** "These are the tricks I use every day that transformed my workflow"

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Prompting basics | First time I got a really great response - what changed |
| Memory feature | How I stopped re-explaining my job to ChatGPT every session |
| Projects feature | Organizing my content creation workflow |
| Model selection | When I learned that picking the right model matters |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| Most tips are too basic | "90% of ChatGPT advice online is stuff you already know" |
| Model selection matters | "Most people don't realize they're using the wrong model for their tasks" |
| Memory is underrated | "The Memory feature alone makes Plus worth it" |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- The "perfect prompt" doesn't exist - it's always iterative
- What works today may change as models evolve
- Not every tip works for every use case

### 7.3 E-E-A-T Demonstration

| E-E-A-T Signal | How We'll Demonstrate |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Experience** | Personal stories about using these tips daily |
| **Expertise** | Technical accuracy, coverage of advanced features |
| **Authoritativeness** | Citing OpenAI documentation, linking to official sources |
| **Trustworthiness** | Acknowledging limitations, honest about what works vs. overhyped |
