## 5. Unique Angle & Voice Strategy

### 5.1 Content Differentiation

**Differentiation:** This is a "6 months later" perspective—not a first-impressions comparison, but an honest assessment after extended daily use of both tools.

**Key Value Proposition:** Real user experience over benchmark scores. Which one do you actually reach for in daily work?

### 5.2 Human Voice Strategy

**Voice Tone:** Thoughtful expert who's developed opinions through experience
**Perspective:** First-person daily usage over 6 months

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Switching between tools | Why I keep both subscriptions |
| Coding tasks | Which one helps more in practice |
| Writing assistance | Noticing the different "voices" |
| Long documents | Claude's advantage for document analysis |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| Overall preference | After 6 months, I reach for Claude more often (for X reasons) |
| Coding | Claude Code is genuinely impressive for complex refactoring |
| Ecosystem | ChatGPT's ecosystem is still unmatched |
| Safety approach | Claude's caution can be frustrating but I've grown to appreciate it |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- Personal preferences vary significantly
- Use cases matter more than "which is better" overall
- Both are improving rapidly—today's winner might not be tomorrow's
