## 1. Primary Keyword Analysis

### Target Keywords
- **Primary:** context window, ai memory
- **Secondary:** context window llm, ai context limit, llm memory
- **Long-tail:** what is context window in ai and why it matters, context window limits of different llms, how to work with ai context limits

### Search Intent
- **Type:** Informational
- **User Goal:** Understanding what context windows are and their practical limitations

## 2. Key Concepts

### What Context Window Is
- Maximum tokens an LLM can process at once
- Includes both input AND output
- "Working memory" or "short-term memory" of AI
- Measured in tokens (not words)

### Current Context Window Sizes (2026)
- **GPT-5:** 128K-400K tokens (varies by tier)
- **Claude 4:** 200K standard, up to 1M for enterprise
- **Gemini 3:** 1M-2M tokens
- Output limits are separate (often smaller)

### Why It Matters
- Limits how much AI can "remember"
- Affects conversation continuity
- Impacts document analysis capability
- Performance degrades near limits ("context rot")

---

## 3. Limitations & Challenges

- Quadratic computational cost as context grows
- Performance at edges (start/end) vs middle
- Cost implications (more tokens = higher cost)
- Not persistent—resets between sessions

---

## 4. Solutions & Workarounds

- Sliding windows / context folding
- Summarization techniques
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- MemGPT virtual memory approach
- External memory systems
