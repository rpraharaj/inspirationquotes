## 7. Unique Angle & Voice Strategy

### 7.1 Content Differentiation

**Differentiation:** The most comprehensive, beginner-friendly guide with real-world examples, common mistake avoidance, and 2026-specific features that competitors don't cover.

**Key Value Proposition:** Readers will go from zero to a working, polished custom GPT in under 30 minutes, with practical examples they can implement immediately.

### 7.2 Human Voice Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Voice Tone:** Friendly, encouraging, slightly informal - like a tech-savvy friend teaching you
**Perspective:** Generic first-person with real observations ("I've created dozens of custom GPTs...")

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|------------------------------|
| First GPT creation | "My first custom GPT was a mess - it kept giving generic responses" |
| Knowledge files | "I learned the hard way that PDFs work better than Word docs" |
| Instructions writing | "After many failed attempts, I discovered the Markdown trick" |
| GPT Store publishing | "When I published my first GPT, I made these rookie mistakes..." |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| GPT Store monetization | "Honestly, the revenue potential is still unclear for most creators" |
| Best use cases | "Personal productivity GPTs are underrated compared to public ones" |
| Instructions format | "I think most people overcomplicate their system prompts" |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- "The GPT Store is still evolving - monetization features may change"
- "Performance can vary depending on your subscription tier"
- "I'm still experimenting with the best instruction formats myself"

### 7.3 E-E-A-T Demonstration

| E-E-A-T Signal | How We'll Demonstrate |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Experience** | First-person stories about creating GPTs, specific examples from real usage |
| **Expertise** | Accurate technical details, current platform features, troubleshooting tips |
| **Authoritativeness** | Citing OpenAI documentation, linking to official resources |
| **Trustworthiness** | Acknowledging limitations, admitting what's still unclear, balanced perspective |
