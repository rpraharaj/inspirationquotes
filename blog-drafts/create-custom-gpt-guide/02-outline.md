## Human Voice Plan

### Opening
- Hook type: Personal observation with rhetorical question
- Specific idea: "I've built over 30 custom GPTs in the past year. Most took under 15 minutes. Some are genuinely useful. Others? Complete disasters I'm too embarrassed to delete."

### Personal Experiences to Include
1. Location: Prerequisites section - Topic: "When I first tried the GPT builder, I assumed coding experience was needed—turns out I was overthinking it"
2. Location: Instructions section - Topic: "My first GPT kept giving bland, generic responses until I figured out the Markdown trick for instructions"
3. Location: Common Mistakes section - Topic: "I once uploaded a massive PDF, only to discover my GPT couldn't actually search it properly"

### Opinion/Hot Take
- Location: Use Cases section
- Take: "Honestly, I think personal productivity GPTs are more valuable than public ones. You can make something weird and specific that no one else needs but you."

### Uncertainty Admission
- Location: GPT Store section
- Phrasing: "The monetization situation is still pretty murky—I wouldn't quit your day job expecting GPT Store revenue just yet"

### Humor/Wit Opportunities
- Location: Testing section
- Idea: "Your first conversation with your new GPT will probably be awkward. That's normal. It's like talking to a new coworker who's overly eager but missed the team memo."
