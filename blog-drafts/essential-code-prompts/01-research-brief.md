## 3. SERP Analysis Insights

### Top Ranking Content Patterns
1. **Formats:** Listicles with 10-25 prompts dominate
2. **Structure:** Categorized by use case (debugging, refactoring, API design)
3. **Differentiators:** Copy-paste ready prompts with explanations
4. **User expectations:** Practical, immediately usable content

### Content Gaps Identified
- Most articles don't cover model-specific prompt techniques (Claude XML tags, GPT system prompts)
- Few articles include real before/after code examples
- Limited coverage of iterative prompting workflows
- Missing security-focused coding prompts
