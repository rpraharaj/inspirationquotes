## 6. Unique Angle & Voice Strategy

### 6.1 Content Differentiation

**Differentiation:** Focus exclusively on ACTUALLY free tools (not free trials), with honest limitations and best use cases for each.

**Key Value Proposition:** A curated list of free AI image generators that really work, with no hidden costs or signup walls where possible.

### 6.2 Human Voice Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Voice Tone:** Friendly expert sharing discoveries, conversational and honest
**Perspective:** First-person experience testing each tool

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Testing generators | "I spent a full week testing these tools..." |
| Surprise discoveries | "Honestly, I didn't expect [tool] to beat paid options" |
| Frustrations | "Let me save you time—some 'free' tools aren't worth it" |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| Best overall | Strong recommendation with reasoning |
| Most overhyped | Calling out tools that don't live up to claims |
| Future of free AI art | Prediction on sustainability of free tiers |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- Free tiers change frequently—checking January 2026 status
- Quality is subjective—depends on your specific use case
- Commercial use policies can be confusing

### 6.3 E-E-A-T Demonstration

| E-E-A-T Signal | How We'll Demonstrate |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Experience** | Testing each tool personally, showing real outputs |
| **Expertise** | Understanding of AI image generation technology |
| **Authoritativeness** | Citing official sources for pricing/limits |
