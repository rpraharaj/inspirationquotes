## Unique Angle

**"Honest assessment of what's ACTUALLY free"**

Most articles list tools as "free" when they're really "free trials" or have crippling limitations. Our angle:

1. **Brutally honest about limits** - Exact message caps, word limits, feature restrictions
2. **"No signup required" callouts** - Highlight tools you can use immediately
3. **Student vs Professional split** - Different needs, different recommendations
4. **Hidden costs exposed** - What happens when you hit the limit?
5. **Personal experience** - "I've used these for 6 months, here's what actually works"

2. **Vague "free tier" descriptions** - We'll give exact numbers
3. **Missing student perspective** - We'll address student needs specifically
4. **No "no-signup" focus** - We'll highlight which need no account
5. **Lack of alternatives to the big names** - We'll include lesser-known gems
