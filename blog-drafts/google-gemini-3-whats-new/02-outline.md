## Human Voice Plan

### Opening
- Hook type: Personal observation with rhetorical question
- Specific idea: "Google just dropped Gemini 3, and I've spent the past few weeks treating it like my new favorite experiment. Has Google finally built an AI that could pull me away from ChatGPT?"

### Personal Experiences to Include
1. Location: What's New section - Topic: "The moment Deep Think mode actually surprised me"
2. Location: Comparison section - Topic: "Testing all three models on the same complex task"
3. Location: Who Should Switch - Topic: "My workflow before and after integrating Gemini 3"

### Opinion/Hot Take
- Location: Conclusion / Verdict section
- Take: "The 'best AI' question is officially dead. The real question is which AI is best for YOUR specific tasks—and the answer might be 'use all three.'"

### Uncertainty Admission
- Location: Future/Predictions section
- Phrasing: "I'm genuinely unsure how long Google will keep the free tier this generous. History suggests... well, you know."

### Humor/Wit Opportunities
- Location: Pricing section
- Idea: "Google AI Ultra at $249/month—for when you need 30TB of storage and want to expense it to your employer"
