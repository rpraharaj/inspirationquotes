## Human Voice Plan

### Opening
- Hook type: Personal observation / Surprising statement
- Specific idea: "August 2025 was wild. GPT-5 dropped, everyone lost their minds, then promptly complained it wasn't as good as GPT-4o. What a rollercoaster."

### Personal Experiences to Include
1. Location: Launch Issues Section - Topic: "The Reddit threads after launch felt like a support group"
2. Location: GPT-5.2 Section - Topic: "GPT-5.2's coding improvements actually surprised me - it handled a complex refactor I'd been putting off"
3. Location: Should You Use GPT-5 - Topic: "I still switch between models depending on the task - there's no one 'best' option"

### Opinion/Hot Take
- Location: Launch Assessment
- Take: "OpenAI rushed the release and it showed. But credit where it's due - they fixed most issues within weeks."

### Uncertainty Admission
- Location: Future sections
- Phrasing: "Honestly? I can't tell you if GPT-5.2 will still be 'best' by the time you read this. This space moves too fast."

### Humor/Wit Opportunities
- Location: Launch Issues
- Idea: "The autoswitcher picking the wrong model felt like ordering a coffee and getting handed a sandwich. Technically edible, but not what you asked for."
