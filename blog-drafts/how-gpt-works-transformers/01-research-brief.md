## 2. Key Concepts

### What GPT Stands For
- **G**enerative - Creates new content
- **P**re-trained - Trained on massive data before use
- **T**ransformer - The neural network architecture

### The Transformer Architecture
- Introduced in 2017 ("Attention Is All You Need" paper)
- Processes entire sequences simultaneously
- Uses attention mechanism to understand relationships
- GPT uses decoder-only transformer

### How It Works (Step by Step)
1. **Tokenization** - Break text into tokens
2. **Embeddings** - Convert tokens to numbers
3. **Positional Encoding** - Add word order info
4. **Self-Attention** - Weigh word relationships
5. **Multi-Head Attention** - Multiple parallel attention
6. **Feed-Forward Networks** - Process information
7. **Output Generation** - Predict next token

## 3. Key Visual Concepts

- Self-attention visualized
- Multi-head attention
- Stacked transformer layers
- Token → Embedding → Output flow

---

## 4. Analogies to Use

- Self-attention = reading a sentence multiple times focusing on different relationships
- Multi-head attention = multiple people reading same text focusing on different aspects
- Stacked layers = re-reading a book deepens understanding
