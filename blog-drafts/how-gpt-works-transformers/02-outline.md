### H2: What Does "GPT" Actually Mean? (350 words)
- Breaking down the acronym
- Generative: creates new content
- Pre-trained: learned from massive data
- Transformer: the architecture

### H2: The Transformer: A Brief History (300 words)
- 2017 "Attention Is All You Need" paper
- Why it was revolutionary
- Previous approaches (RNNs) and their limits
- GPT uses decoder-only architecture

---

### H2: How GPT Processes Text (Step by Step) (800 words)

#### H3: Step 1 - Tokenization
- Breaking text into pieces
- Why tokens, not words

**Internal Link:** [Tokens explained](/blog/tokens-in-ai-explained)

#### H3: Step 2 - Converting to Numbers (Embeddings)
- Words → vectors
- Similar words have similar vectors

#### H3: Step 3 - Adding Position Information
- Positional encoding
- Why word order matters

#### H3: Step 4 - The Attention Mechanism (The Key Innovation)
- Self-attention explained simply
- "Which words should I pay attention to?"
- Analogy: reading with different focus

#### H3: Step 5 - Multi-Head Attention
- Multiple attention mechanisms in parallel
- Different "perspectives" on the text

#### H3: Step 6 - Building Understanding (Layers)
- Stacked transformer blocks
- Deeper understanding with each layer

### H2: How GPT Generates Text (400 words)
- Predicting the next token
- Temperature and sampling
- One token at a time, iteratively

---

### H2: What Makes GPT Different from Earlier AI (350 words)
- RNNs and sequential processing
- Why attention changed everything
- Parallelization benefits
- Long-range dependencies

---

### H2: GPT vs Other Transformer Models (400 words)
- GPT = decoder-only
- BERT = encoder-only
- T5 = encoder-decoder
- When each is used

### H2: FAQ Section (400 words)
1. Is GPT "really" understanding language?
2. How much data was GPT trained on?
3. Can I train my own GPT?
4. What's the difference between GPT and ChatGPT?
5. Will transformers be replaced?

---

### Conclusion (200 words)
- Recap: tokenize → embed → attend → generate
- Transformers are powerful but not magic
- Understanding helps you use AI better
