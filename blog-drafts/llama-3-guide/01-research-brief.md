## 6. Unique Angle & Voice Strategy

### 6.1 Content Differentiation

**Differentiation:** A complete, beginner-friendly guide that covers BOTH the conceptual understanding of Llama 3 AND practical hands-on steps to run it locally—something most guides split into separate articles.

**Key Value Proposition:** Readers will go from zero knowledge to running their own local Llama 3 instance in one comprehensive guide, while understanding why this matters for privacy, cost, and customization.

### 6.2 Human Voice Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Voice Tone:** Enthusiastic but practical, like a developer friend sharing something exciting
**Perspective:** Generic first-person ("I've been running Llama 3 locally for months now...", "When I first saw the benchmarks...")

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Running local AI | First reaction to seeing a 70B model run on consumer hardware |
| Llama vs ChatGPT | Comparison from hands-on testing both |
| Model size selection | Learning curve choosing between 8B and 70B |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| Open-source AI future | Llama 3 represents a tipping point where open-source matches proprietary |
| Local AI benefits | Privacy benefits are often underestimated by beginners |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- Benchmarks don't always reflect real-world performance
- The "best" model depends heavily on your specific use case and hardware

### 6.3 E-E-A-T Demonstration

| E-E-A-T Signal | How We'll Demonstrate |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Experience** | Hands-on testing stories, personal observations from running models |
| **Expertise** | Technical accuracy on model architecture, correct version numbers |
| **Authoritativeness** | Citations to Meta official docs, Hugging Face, benchmark sources |
| **Trustworthiness** | Honest comparison with proprietary models, acknowledging limitations |
