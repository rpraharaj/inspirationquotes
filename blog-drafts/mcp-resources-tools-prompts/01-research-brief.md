- how mcp exposes tools and resources

## Search Intent
**Intent Type:** Informational
**User Need:** Developers and technical users who want to understand the three core primitives of MCP (Resources, Tools, and Prompts) and how to use them effectively.

## Target Audience
- AI developers building MCP servers
- Technical architects evaluating MCP
- Claude Desktop and IDE users wanting to understand capabilities
- Enterprise teams implementing MCP integrations

## Competitor Analysis

### Top Ranking Content
1. **Official MCP Documentation (modelcontextprotocol.io)** - Authoritative but technical
2. **Medium articles** - Good explanations but lack depth
3. **Dev.to tutorials** - Practical but scattered

### Content Gaps
- No comprehensive single resource covering all three primitives
- Missing practical examples of each primitive type
- Lack of comparison between primitives
- No guidance on when to use which primitive

## Unique Angle
A developer-focused complete reference that explains all three MCP primitives in one place, with practical code examples, use case guidance, and architecture diagrams. Focus on the newly donated MCP to Linux Foundation and 2026 developments.

## Key Points to Cover

### 1. MCP Architecture Overview
- Host Applications, Clients, Servers
- JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol
- STDIO vs HTTP/SSE transports
- Bidirectional communication

### 2. Resources (Data Exposure)
- What are MCP resources
- Types of resources (files, databases, APIs)
- Resource URIs and templates
- Embedded resources in prompts
- MCP Registry for discovery

### 3. Tools (Action Execution)
- What are MCP tools
- Tool schemas and metadata
- Model-controlled vs user-controlled
- Human-in-the-loop for security
- Examples: database queries, API calls, computations

### 4. Prompts (Structured Instructions)
- What are MCP prompts
- Prompt templates and arguments
- User-initiated vs model-initiated
- Slash commands pattern
- Dynamic prompt generation

### 5. Primitive Comparison
- When to use Resources vs Tools vs Prompts
- Decision matrix
- Combining primitives

### 6. Security Considerations
- Tool poisoning risks
- Access controls
- Consent and authorization

### 7. 2026 Developments
- MCP donated to Linux Foundation (AAIF)
- MCP Registry GA
- OAuth support
- Streaming HTTP transport

## Supporting Data

### Statistics to Include
- 75% of companies expected to adopt MCP by 2026
