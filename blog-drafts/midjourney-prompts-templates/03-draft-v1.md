Three months ago, my Midjourney results were... fine. Generic AI art that looked like everyone else's. Then I discovered what separates mediocre prompts from exceptional ones, and everything changed.

The difference isn't luck or magic. It's specific structures, techniques, and parameters that consistently produce professional-quality images. I've spent countless hours refining these prompts, and now I'm sharing the 50 templates that deliver the best results.

Every prompt here is copy-paste ready. Just replace the bracketed sections with your specific subjects, and you're ready to generate.

## How to Use These Prompt Templates

Before we dive into the templates, let's make sure you get the most out of them.

### The Anatomy of a Great Midjourney Prompt

Effective Midjourney prompts follow a consistent structure:

**Subject + Environment + Lighting + Style + Technical Parameters**

For example:
- Subject: "A weathered fisherman with deep wrinkles"
- Environment: "on a wooden dock at dawn"
- Lighting: "warm golden hour light, rim lighting on hair"
- Style: "portrait photography, candid moment"
- Parameters: "--ar 2:3 --style raw"

### Essential Parameters You'll See

- **--ar [ratio]**: Aspect ratio (16:9, 2:3, 1:1, etc.)
- **--style raw**: Removes Midjourney's default artistic styling for more photorealistic results
- **--stylize [0-1000]**: Lower numbers follow your prompt more closely; higher numbers allow more artistic freedom
- **--no [element]**: Excludes unwanted elements

### Customizing the Templates

Throughout these templates, you'll see [BRACKETS] indicating elements you should replace:
- [SUBJECT] = Person, object, or scene description
- [ENVIRONMENT] = Location or setting
- [DETAILS] = Specific characteristics
- [COLOR] = Color choices
- [STYLE] = Artistic reference

## Pro Tips for Better Results

After testing hundreds of prompts, here's what I've learned:

### Prompt Length Sweet Spot

Midjourney works best with prompts between 40-75 words. Too short and you lose control. Too long and the AI gets confused. The templates above hit this sweet spot.

### When to Use --style raw

Use `--style raw` when you want:
- Photorealistic results
- Less "AI art" aesthetic
- Images that look like actual photographs

Skip it when you want:
- More artistic interpretation
- Stylized illustration
- Creative surprises

### Iterating and Refining

The first result is rarely the best. I typically:
1. Generate 4 images from the initial prompt
2. Upscale promising options
3. Use "vary subtle" or "vary strong" on favorites
4. Note what worked for future prompts

### Combining Template Elements

These templates are starting points. Mix elements from different categories:
- Lighting from portrait templates + subject from product templates
- Mood from noir + setting from cyberpunk
- Technical settings from landscape + composition from architecture

Experimentation is how you develop your own signature style.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the best aspect ratio for portraits?

For vertical portraits, use `--ar 2:3` or `--ar 4:5`. For headshots, `--ar 2:3` works well. For full-body, consider `--ar 3:4` or even `--ar 9:16` for social media.

### How do I get more realistic results?

Add `--style raw` to remove Midjourney's artistic styling. Include camera and lens specifications in your prompt. Reference real photography techniques like lighting setups and film stocks.

### Can I combine multiple prompts?

Yes, use the `::` syntax to weight different concepts. For example: `portrait photography:: moody lighting::2 warm colors::0.5` gives double weight to moody lighting.

### What's the difference between --stylize values?

- 0-100: Very literal interpretation of your prompt
- 100-400: Balanced creativity and prompt adherence
- 400-1000: Maximum artistic freedom, may drift from prompt

For these templates, I recommend 0-300 for most uses, higher for abstract/artistic work.

## Conclusion

These 50 templates represent hundreds of hours of testing and refinement. They're designed to give you consistent, professional results across every category of image generation.

The key to mastering Midjourney isn't memorizing prompts—it's understanding why certain elements work together. As you use these templates, pay attention to which techniques produce results you love, then incorporate them into your own creative work.

Start with the templates that match your needs, customize them with your specific subjects, and don't be afraid to experiment.
