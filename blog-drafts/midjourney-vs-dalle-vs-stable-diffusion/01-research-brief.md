## 7. Unique Angle & Voice Strategy

### 7.1 Content Differentiation

**Differentiation:** We'll provide an experience-based comparison with real-world creative workflow contexts—not just features, but *when* and *why* to use each tool based on actual project types.

**Key Value Proposition:** Clear "winner by category" verdicts with specific use case recommendations (Midjourney for art direction, DALL-E for text-heavy marketing, Stable Diffusion for technical control/privacy).

### 7.2 Human Voice Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Voice Tone:** Professional but conversational, like a designer friend giving honest advice
**Perspective:** First-person experience ("I've tested all three extensively", "In my experience...")

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Midjourney aesthetic | Confession about getting hooked on the "Midjourney look" |
| DALL-E text rendering | Surprise at how well it handles logos and signs |
| Stable Diffusion setup | Honest take on the learning curve for local deployment |
| Pricing value | Real talk about which subscription makes sense for whom |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| Is Midjourney worth 3x the price? | Strong stance: "For artistic work, absolutely—for quick mockups, probably not" |
| Local vs cloud debate | "Privacy is underrated—not everyone needs their prompts analyzed" |
| Text rendering winner | "DALL-E wins text hands-down, and it's not even close" |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- The "best" generator changes based on your specific needs—there's no universal winner
- AI image quality is improving so fast that today's comparisons may shift in 6 months
- Artistic "quality" is subjective—what looks amazing to me might not suit your style

### 7.3 E-E-A-T Demonstration

| E-E-A-T Signal | How We'll Demonstrate |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Experience** | First-hand testing stories, comparative results |
| **Expertise** | Technical accuracy on model versions, parameters |
| **Authoritativeness** | Links to official docs, citing official announcements |
| **Trustworthiness** | Honest pros/cons, admitting when one tool beats another |
