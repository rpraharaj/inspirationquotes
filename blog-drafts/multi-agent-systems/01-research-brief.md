## 6. Unique Angle & Voice Strategy

### 6.1 Content Differentiation

**Differentiation:** This post explains multi-agent systems like explaining to a smart friend—using analogies (like a well-organized office), not jargon. Shows the "why" before the "how."

**Key Value Proposition:** Readers will understand both the architecture concepts AND practical applications, with concrete examples they can relate to.

### 6.2 Human Voice Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Voice Tone:** Curious, explanatory, conversational
**Perspective:** Generic first-person ("When I first heard about...", "Here's how I think about it...")

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Initial confusion | Not understanding why you'd need multiple agents |
| Aha moment | When multi-agent architecture clicked |
| Failed attempts | When a single agent approach breaks down |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| Framework choice | You probably don't need fancy frameworks to start |
| Orchestration | The orchestrator is the most underrated component |
| Complexity | Most projects don't need multi-agent—but when you do, you really do |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- Best practices are still evolving rapidly
- There's no consensus on the "right" architecture
- Scaling multi-agent systems remains challenging

### 6.3 E-E-A-T Demonstration

| E-E-A-T Signal | How We'll Demonstrate |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Experience** | First-person exploration of concepts |
| **Expertise** | Technical accuracy, proper terminology |
| **Authoritativeness** | Citing Deloitte, industry sources |
| **Trustworthiness** | Balanced view of pros and cons |
