## 7. Unique Angle & Voice Strategy

### 7.1 Content Differentiation

**Differentiation:** Practical buyer's guide with clear recommendations by use case and budget, not just specs comparison

**Key Value Proposition:** Real-world guidance on which GPU to buy based on what you actually want to do with AI locally - from running chatbots to training models

### 7.2 Human Voice Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Voice Tone:** Professional but warm, conversational
**Perspective:** Generic first-person ("I've seen...", "In my experience...")

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|------------------------------|
| GPU selection | "Here's the thing that surprised me when I started running AI locally..." |
| CUDA vs ROCm | "I'll be honest - I was skeptical about AMD for AI until recently" |
| VRAM importance | "Nothing's more frustrating than running out of VRAM mid-inference" |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| NVIDIA premium | "Yes, NVIDIA dominates for good reason - but AMD is closing the gap faster than most realize" |
| Budget picks | "The best AI GPU isn't always the most expensive one" |
| Future outlook | "I think we'll see real choice in AI GPUs within 2 years" |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- ROCm compatibility varies - some models work flawlessly, others don't
- GPU pricing fluctuates significantly
- New releases could shift recommendations

### 7.3 E-E-A-T Demonstration

| E-E-A-T Signal | How We'll Demonstrate |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Experience** | Personal observations about testing GPUs for AI |
| **Expertise** | Technical accuracy about CUDA, ROCm, VRAM requirements |
| **Authoritativeness** | Citing official NVIDIA/AMD specs and announcements |
| **Trustworthiness** | Balanced perspective, acknowledging AMD improvements |
