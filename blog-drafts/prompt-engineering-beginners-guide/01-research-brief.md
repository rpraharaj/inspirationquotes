## 6. Unique Angle & Voice Strategy

### 6.1 Content Differentiation

**Differentiation:** A truly beginner-friendly guide that teaches the "why" behind techniques, not just the "what"—with 2026-relevant examples across ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

**Key Value Proposition:** Go from "I don't know what to type" to "I understand how AI thinks and how to talk to it" in one article.

### 6.2 Human Voice Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Voice Tone:** Patient teacher, not condescending
**Perspective:** "I've taught this to hundreds of people—here's what works"

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Learning curve | "When I started, my prompts were terrible" |
| Aha moments | "The moment it clicked for me was..." |
| Common mistakes | "I see this mistake all the time" |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| Complexity | "Most prompt engineering advice is overcomplicated" |
| No-code | "You don't need to be technical—anyone can learn this" |
| Model differences | "The techniques are mostly the same across AI tools" |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- AI keeps changing—what works today might need adjustment
- No "perfect" prompt exists—it's always iterative
- Different tasks need different approaches

### 6.3 E-E-A-T Demonstration

| E-E-A-T Signal | How We'll Demonstrate |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Experience** | Personal learning journey, teaching experience |
| **Expertise** | Technical accuracy, up-to-date techniques |
| **Authoritativeness** | Links to official docs, research sources |
| **Trustworthiness** | Honest about limitations, practical advice |
