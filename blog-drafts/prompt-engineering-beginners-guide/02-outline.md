### H2: The 5 Fundamental Principles (800-900 words)

#### H3: 1. Be Specific and Clear
- Why vagueness kills AI output
- Before/after examples
- The "5W1H" framework (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How)
- Practical exercise

#### H3: 2. Provide Context
- Why AI needs background information
- What context to include (and what to skip)
- Example: Writing an email with vs. without context
- Personal experience: When context made everything click

#### H3: 3. Define Your Output Format
- Tell AI exactly what you want back
- Format examples: Bullet points, paragraphs, tables, JSON
- Before/after comparison
- Pro tip: Show an example of the format you want

#### H3: 4. Use Examples (Few-Shot Prompting)
- What few-shot means (with examples, not zero examples)
- When to use examples vs. just describe
- How many examples (usually 1-3)
- Practical demonstration

#### H3: 5. Iterate and Refine
- No perfect first prompt—it's normal to iterate
- How to diagnose what went wrong
- The refinement loop
- Mindset shift: Conversation, not command
- Personal take: "Iteration is where the magic happens"

- Best roles for different tasks
- Example: Expert vs. Beginner perspective
- When role prompting backfires

#### H3: Chain of Thought Prompting
- What it means: Ask AI to think step-by-step
- Why it improves complex reasoning
- Magic phrase: "Think through this step by step"
- When to use (math, logic, complex analysis)
- Example with comparison

#### H3: Constraints and Boundaries
- Why limits improve output
- Types of constraints: Length, tone, format, content
- Example: "In 100 words or less..."
- Balancing constraints (not too many, not too few)
