## 1. Key Research Findings

### Prompt Engineering Best Practices
- Be specific and detailed (language, task, algorithm, constraints)
- Provide context and examples (few-shot prompting)
- Break down complex tasks (prompt chaining)
- Define output structure (JSON, code format)
- Use advanced techniques (chain-of-thought, role-based, reflection)
- Iterate and refine

### Tips for AI Code Generation
- Master code literacy and architecture
- Use Test-Driven Development with AI
- Context engineering is paramount
- Treat AI as "junior intern" (oversight needed)
- Choose right tools for each task
- Prioritize specification-driven development
