## 🚀 Quick Start by Scenario

> [!NOTE]
> Choose the scenario that matches your current situation. Each includes a step-by-step checklist.

### Scenario A: Building from Scratch

<details>
<summary><b>🆕 Starting a brand new application with AI assistance</b></summary>

#### Step 1: Define Your Vision ⏱️ *30 min*

```bash
□ Copy this template to your project root
□ Open 00-context/vision.md
□ Answer these questions:
  ✓ What problem does this solve?
  ✓ Who is the target user?
  ✓ What are the boundaries (what we will NOT build)?
  ✓ How do we measure success?
```

#### Step 2: Write Your PRD ⏱️ *1-2 hours*

```bash
□ Open 01-product/prd.md
□ List your user stories
□ Define acceptance criteria for each
□ Prioritize: P0 (must have), P1 (should have), P2 (nice to have)
```

#### Step 3: Plan Your First Feature ⏱️ *1 hour*

```bash
□ Create folder: 02-features/{{first-feature-name}}/
□ Create feature-spec.md (use template)
□ Create tech-design.md (architecture decisions)
□ Create dev-tasks.md (atomic, LLM-executable tasks)
□ Create test-plan.md (validation criteria)
```

#### Step 4: Start Building

```bash
□ Initialize system-state.md with tech stack
□ Follow daily workflow in 04-process/dev-workflow.md
□ Start with TASK-001 from dev-tasks.md
```

</details>

---

### Scenario B: Adopting for Existing Project

<details>
<summary><b>📦 Adding this documentation system to an existing codebase</b></summary>

#### Step 1: Audit Current State ⏱️ *1-2 hours*

```bash
□ Open 00-context/system-state.md
□ Document:
  ✓ Current tech stack (frameworks, libraries, versions)
  ✓ Existing file/folder structure
  ✓ What features are built
  ✓ Current deployment setup
  ✓ Known issues and technical debt
```

#### Step 2: Reverse-Engineer the Vision ⏱️ *30 min*

```bash
□ Open 00-context/vision.md
□ Based on existing code, document:
  ✓ What the product does
  ✓ Who uses it
  ✓ Core principles (inferred from code patterns)
  ✓ Boundaries (what it doesn't do)
```

#### Step 3: Backfill Key Decisions ⏱️ *1 hour*

```bash
□ Open 03-logs/decisions-log.md
□ Document major past decisions:
  ✓ Why was this framework chosen?
  ✓ Why this database?
  ✓ Why this architecture pattern?
  ✓ Any decisions you wish were different?
```

#### Step 4: Create Feature Documentation

```bash
□ For each major existing feature:
  ✓ Create 02-features/{{feature-name}}/
  ✓ Write feature-spec.md (what it does now)
  ✓ Write tech-design.md (current architecture)
  ✓ Skip dev-tasks.md (already built)
  ✓ Create test-plan.md if tests don't exist
```

#### Step 5: Plan Your Next Enhancement

```bash
□ Create 02-features/{{new-feature-name}}/
□ Follow Scenario C workflow below
```

> [!WARNING]
> Don't try to document everything at once! Start with high-level docs, then add detail as you work on each feature.

</details>

---

### Scenario C: Adding a New Feature

<details>
<summary><b>✨ Planning and building a new feature in an existing project</b></summary>

#### Step 1: Create Feature Folder

```bash
□ Create 02-features/{{feature-name}}/
□ Copy templates from _templates/02-features/
```

#### Step 2: Write Feature Spec ⏱️ *30-60 min*

```bash
□ Open feature-spec.md
□ Define:
  ✓ Purpose: Why this feature?
  ✓ User Intent: What is the user trying to do?
  ✓ Acceptance Criteria: How do we know it's done?
  ✓ Edge Cases: What could go wrong?
  ✓ Out of Scope: What are we NOT building?
```

#### Step 3: Write Technical Design ⏱️ *1-2 hours*

```bash
□ Open tech-design.md
□ Define:
  ✓ Component architecture
  ✓ Data models
  ✓ API changes (if any)
  ✓ Dependencies on existing code
  ✓ Performance considerations
```

#### Step 4: Break Down into Tasks ⏱️ *30 min*

```bash
□ Open dev-tasks.md
□ Create atomic tasks (30-60 min each)
□ Each task must have:
  ✓ Clear title
  ✓ Context files to reference
  ✓ Detailed description
  ✓ Acceptance criteria
```

#### Step 5: Build

```bash
□ Follow 04-process/dev-workflow.md
□ Complete one task at a time
□ Log everything in 03-logs/
```

> [!TIP]
> Small, atomic tasks = better AI assistance. Aim for tasks that take 30-60 minutes each.

</details>

### Scenario D: Fixing a Bug

<details>
<summary><b>🐛 Investigating and fixing an issue in the codebase</b></summary>

#### Step 1: Log the Bug

```bash
□ Open 03-logs/bug-log.md
□ Create entry with:
  ✓ Bug ID (BUG-XXX)
  ✓ Description
  ✓ Reproduction steps
  ✓ Expected vs actual behavior
  ✓ Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
```

#### Step 2: Investigate with AI

```markdown
□ Share with AI:
  ✓ Bug description from bug-log.md
  ✓ Relevant code files
  ✓ Error messages/stack traces
  ✓ What you've already tried
□ Ask AI to help identify root cause
```

#### Step 3: Fix and Test

```bash
□ Implement the fix
□ Verify reproduction steps no longer reproduce bug
□ Test for regressions
□ Add a test to prevent regression
```

#### Step 4: Document

```bash
□ Update bug-log.md with:
  ✓ Root cause
  ✓ Fix applied
  ✓ Prevention measures
□ Update implementation-log.md with changes
□ Commit: "fix: [description] (BUG-XXX)"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always document the **root cause**, not just the symptom. This prevents similar bugs in the future.

</details>

---

### Scenario E: Refactoring Code

<details>
<summary><b>♻️ Improving code quality without changing functionality</b></summary>

#### Step 1: Document Intent

```bash
□ Open 03-logs/decisions-log.md
□ Create ADR entry:
  ✓ What are you refactoring?
  ✓ Why? (tech debt, performance, readability)
  ✓ What's the target state?
```

#### Step 2: Create Refactoring Tasks

```bash
□ Create 02-features/refactor-{{name}}/dev-tasks.md
□ Break into small, safe refactoring steps
□ Each task should:
  ✓ Not change external behavior
  ✓ Be testable independently
  ✓ Be revertible if needed
```

#### Step 3: Execute Safely

```bash
□ Run tests before starting (baseline)
□ Refactor one task at a time
□ Run tests after each task
□ Commit after each passing test
```

#### Step 4: Document Outcomes

```bash
□ Update system-state.md if architecture changed
□ Update tech-design.md if patterns changed
□ Log learnings in 03-logs/insights.md
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Never refactor without tests! If tests don't exist, write them first.

## 📚 Directory Guide

### `00-context/` - WHY and WHAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW

> 🎯 **Purpose:** Provides foundational context for all development work

| File | Purpose | Update Frequency | Key Audience |
|------|---------|------------------|--------------|
| **`vision.md`** | Product purpose, boundaries, north star | Rarely (major pivots) | Everyone |
| **`assumptions.md`** | Risks, unknowns, and assumptions | Weekly or when validated | PMs, Leads |
| **`system-state.md`** | Current tech stack and deployment | After major changes | Developers, AI |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Start every LLM conversation by referencing `vision.md`**

---

### `01-product/` - WHAT the product must do

> 📦 **Purpose:** Single source of truth for requirements

| File | Purpose | Update Frequency | Key Audience |
|------|---------|------------------|--------------|
| **`prd.md`** | Product requirements, user stories | As scope changes | PMs, Developers |

---

### `_templates/` - BASE TEMPLATES FOR LLM USE

> 📋 **Purpose:** Standardized templates for AI assistants to generate consistent documents

All base templates are centralized here for easy reference:

```plaintext
_templates/
├── README.md                    # How to use templates
├── 00-context/
│   ├── vision_template.md
│   ├── assumptions_template.md
│   └── system-state_template.md
├── 01-product/
│   └── prd_template.md
├── 02-features/
│   ├── feature-spec_template.md
│   ├── tech-design_template.md
│   ├── dev-tasks_template.md
│   └── test-plan_template.md
└── 03-logs/
    ├── implementation-log_template.md
    ├── decisions-log_template.md
    ├── bug-log_template.md
    ├── validation-log_template.md
    └── insights_template.md
```

**🤖 LLM Usage:** When asked to create a document, reference the appropriate template from this folder.

---

### `02-features/` - HOW features are designed & built

> 🔧 **Purpose:** Feature-specific planning and implementation details

Create a new folder for each feature:

```plaintext
02-features/
├── expense-entry/           # ✅ Example completed feature
│   ├── feature-spec.md      # What it does
│   ├── tech-design.md       # How it's built
│   ├── dev-tasks.md         # Implementation tasks
│   └── test-plan.md         # Validation criteria
└── {{new-feature}}/         # 🆕 Copy templates for new features
    └── ...
```

---

### `03-logs/` - MEMORY (This is what most teams miss!)

> 🧠 **Purpose:** Provide AI assistants with "memory" across sessions

| File | Purpose | Update Frequency | Why Critical |

```

<details>
<summary><b>Click to see the loop in detail</b></summary>

### 1️⃣ Context Load

**What:** Provide AI with necessary background

```markdown
Share these files:
- 00-context/vision.md (always)
- Relevant feature-spec.md
- Relevant tech-design.md
- Recent implementation-log.md entries
```

### 2️⃣ Task Selection

**What:** Choose an atomic, well-defined task

```markdown
Good task criteria:
✅ Takes 30-60 minutes
✅ Has clear acceptance criteria
✅ References specific files
✅ Is independent (low coupling)
```

### 3️⃣ Implementation

**What:** Build the feature with AI assistance

```markdown
Best practices:
- Start with tests (if TDD)
- Implement incrementally
- Ask AI to explain decisions
- Review generated code carefully
```

### 4️⃣ Validation

**What:** Verify the task is complete

```markdown
Check against:
✅ Acceptance criteria in dev-tasks.md
✅ Test plan in test-plan.md
✅ Definition of done in 04-process/
```

### 5️⃣ Documentation

**What:** Update logs for future sessions

```markdown
Update:
- implementation-log.md (what changed)
- decisions-log.md (if architectural choice made)
- bug-log.md (if bug discovered)
```

### 6️⃣ Commit

**What:** Save work with clear message

```markdown
Format: type(scope): description (TASK-XXX)

Examples:
- feat(auth): add login form (TASK-012)
- fix(api): handle null user (BUG-005)
- refactor(db): extract query logic (TASK-034)
```

</details>

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### ✅ DO

| Practice | Why | Example |
|----------|-----|---------|
| **Keep vision.md concise** | Under 500 words - it's an anchor, not a novel | ✅ "Build a budgeting app for freelancers" |
| **Make tasks atomic** | Each task should be completable in one LLM session | ✅ "Implement login form validation" |
| **Log everything** | The logs ARE your project's memory | ✅ Update implementation-log.md after each session |
| **Reference docs in prompts** | Give AI context it needs | ✅ "Based on vision.md and tech-design.md..." |
| **Update system-state.md** | Keep it current so LLM knows what exists | ✅ Document new dependencies immediately |

---

### ❌ DON'T

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Instead |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Skip the logs** | Every conversation starts from zero | ❌ Log decisions and implementations |
| **Write vague tasks** | "Make it work" isn't actionable | ❌ Be specific: "Add email validation to signup" |
| **Let docs go stale** | Outdated docs → confused LLM → bad code | ❌  Update docs when code changes |
| **Mix features** | Creates coupling and confusion | ❌ One feature folder per capability |

> [!CAUTION]
> Stale docs are worse than no docs! They actively mislead AI assistants.
