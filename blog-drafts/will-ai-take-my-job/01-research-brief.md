## 6. Unique Angle & Voice Strategy

### 6.1 Content Differentiation

**Differentiation:** Balances data transparency with practical hope - neither doom-and-gloom nor toxic positivity. Includes a "Risk Assessment Framework" readers can apply to their own jobs.

**Key Value Proposition:** Honest analysis backed by authoritative data PLUS concrete action steps for any risk level

### 6.2 Human Voice Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Voice Tone:** Empathetic but factual, reassuring but realistic, practical advisor
**Perspective:** Generic first-person ("I've spoken with many worried professionals...", "My honest assessment...")

#### Personal Experience Opportunities

| Topic Area | Potential Experience to Share |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Initial AI fears | Acknowledging own uncertainty when AI emerged |
| Observing transformations | What I've seen happen to specific roles |
| Skills development | Learning AI tools myself |

#### Opinion/Hot Take Opportunities

| Topic | Potential Opinion |
|-------|-------------------|
| "AI will take all jobs" panic | Overblown for most workers, but complacency is dangerous |
| Entry-level positions | These ARE at real risk - not just hype |
| Upskilling timelines | People underestimate how quickly they can adapt |

#### Uncertainty to Acknowledge

- We don't know the pace of adoption
- Predictions range wildly (that's honest, not weak)
- Individual outcomes depend heavily on industry and initiative

### 6.3 E-E-A-T Demonstration

| E-E-A-T Signal | How We'll Demonstrate |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Experience** | Observations of workforce changes, personal learning journey |
| **Expertise** | Citing Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, WEF authoritatively |
| **Authoritativeness** | Linking to official reports, balanced analysis |
| **Trustworthiness** | Acknowledging uncertainty, providing balanced view |
