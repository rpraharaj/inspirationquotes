### H2: What the Data Actually Says (The Research Is Complicated) (600 words)

**Central tension:** Why predictions vary wildly - and what to make of that

#### H3: The Job Displacement Numbers

**Goldman Sachs findings:**
- 6-7% of US workforce could be displaced
- 25 million full-time job equivalents by 2026
- But: "modest and temporary" impact expected
- Productivity boost: 15% in developed markets

**McKinsey findings:**
- 57% of US work hours *could* theoretically be automated
- 40% of jobs in "highly automatable" categories
- But: This is technical potential, not prediction
- Reality: Jobs evolve, don't disappear entirely

**World Economic Forum:**
- Initial: 97M jobs created vs. 85M displaced (net +12M)
- Updated for 2027: 83M lost vs. 69M created (net -14M)
- Contradictory? Different timeframes, different methodologies

#### H3: Why Experts Disagree So Much

- Measuring "jobs" vs. "tasks" vs. "hours"
- Pace of adoption unknowable
- Historical precedent mixed
- **Honest admission:** Nobody really knows

**Human voice notes:**
- "These numbers are all over the place, and that's honest"
- Own opinion on which data seems most credible

**Statistics to include (with sources):**
- Goldman Sachs percentages
- McKinsey automation potential
- WEF job creation/destruction estimates
