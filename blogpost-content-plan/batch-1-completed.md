## Changes Made

### Internal Links Added (per post)
- Average +3 new internal links per post
- Links strategically placed within content (not just footer)
- Category-based linking strategy applied

### External Links Added
- Authoritative sources added where contextually appropriate
- Official tool sites linked (Perplexity, Runway, Pika, etc.)
- Research/statistics sources added

### Frontmatter Updates
- `updatedDate: 2026-01-13` added to all 10 posts

## Remaining Work for These Posts

### Incoming Links (Orphan Resolution)
All 10 posts are still orphans or near-orphans. Need to add links FROM other posts TO these posts:

| Post | Target Posts That Should Link Here |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| ai-music-generators | free-ai-image-generators, text-to-video-ai, ai-for-graphic-designers |
| chatgpt-for-students | how-to-use-chatgpt, best-chatgpt-prompts-2026, chatgpt-tips-and-tricks |
| notion-vs-mem-vs-obsidian-ai | best-ai-tools-everyone-should-use, ai-productivity-tools |
| sora-vs-runway-vs-pika | text-to-video-ai, sora-ai-guide |
| ai-real-estate-tools | ai-in-finance, ai-for-lawyers, ai-marketing-tools |
| perplexity-vs-chatgpt-vs-google-ai-research | chatgpt-vs-claude-vs-gemini, ai-research-tools |
| free-vs-paid-ai-tools | best-ai-tools-everyone-should-use, free-ai-tools-worth-using |
| prompt-debugging | prompt-engineering-beginners-guide, chain-of-thought-prompting |
| ai-meeting-assistants | ai-productivity-tools-save-hours, ai-tools-small-business |
| ai-presentation-tools | ai-productivity-tools-save-hours, ai-marketing-tools |

### External Links Gap
- ai-presentation-tools still needs external links (Gamma or Tome official docs)

## Next Steps
1. Process Critical Batch 2 (next 10 orphan pages)
2. Add incoming links by updating higher-traffic hub posts
3. Regenerate analytics after each batch
