## Analytics Note

The blog analytics script currently counts only markdown-style external links (`[text](url)`), not HTML-style links (`<a href="url">text</a>`). Several posts in this batch already had well-integrated HTML external links that aren't reflected in the "external" count.

**Posts with pre-existing HTML external links:**
- `ai-avatars-guide.md`: HeyGen, Synthesia, D-ID
- `nvidia-vs-amd-for-ai.md`: Statista, ROCm docs, PyTorch, AMD events
- `ai-logo-makers.md`: Looka, Brandmark, LogoAI, Canva
- `build-offline-ai.md`: Ollama, LM Studio, Open WebUI
- `future-vibe-coding.md`: Cursor changelog, GitHub Copilot roadmap, O'Reilly
