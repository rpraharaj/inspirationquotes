## 💡 How Users Will Benefit

### **Scenario 1: First-Time User**
**Goal:** Find agents for their role

**Journey:**
1. Read blog post intro → See agent selection guide
2. Find their role (e.g., "Full-Stack Developer")
3. Get recommendation: Frontend Developer + Backend Architect
4. ** 30 seconds** to identify perfect agents

**vs. Before:** Read entire post, trial and error = **10+ minutes**

---

### **Scenario 2: MCP Integration**
**Goal:** Set up agents with database access

**Journey:**
1. Check MCP Integration Guide
2. Find "Pattern 2: Data-Driven Product Decisions"
3. Copy-paste MCP config + workflow
4. **30 minutes** to working implementation

**vs. Before:** Research MCP docs, experiment, debug = **2-3 days**

---

### **Scenario 3: Cost Optimization**
**Goal:** Reduce API costs while maintaining quality

**Journey:**
1. Read Model Selection Guide
2. See task: "Code Review <1K lines" → Use Sonnet ($0.60)
3. Implement prompt caching (90% savings)
4. **Monthly cost: $430 vs. $2,400** (82% savings)

**vs. Before:** Always use Opus, no optimization = **5.5x higher costs**
