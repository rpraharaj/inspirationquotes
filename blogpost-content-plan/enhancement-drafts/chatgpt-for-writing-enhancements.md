### Quality Checks Before Publishing

AI-assisted writing still needs human quality control. Before publishing anything:

**Read Aloud.** AI often produces grammatically correct but awkward sentences. Reading aloud catches unnatural phrasing your eyes might miss.

**Check for Repetition.** AI loves to repeat phrases across paragraphs. Search for common words and vary them if they appear too often.

**Verify Voice Consistency.** Does the first paragraph sound like the last? AI can drift in tone. Ensure your voice stays stable throughout.

**Add Personal Details.** Insert specific anecdotes, statistics from your experience, or opinions only you would hold. This is what makes content genuinely yours.

## What's Next?

ChatGPT has fundamentally changed what one writer can produce. The question isn't whether to use AI—it's how to use it well.

Here's your action plan:

**This week:** Choose one piece of content you need to create. Use AI for ideation, drafting, and a single editing pass. Time yourself against your normal process.

**This month:** Build a prompt library for your three most common content types. Refine them until you consistently get usable first drafts.

**Ongoing:** Note where AI helps most and where you always need to intervene. Use this insight to optimize your workflow continuously.

The writers who thrive with AI aren't those who resist it or depend on it entirely—they're the ones who've found the balance. Start finding yours today.
