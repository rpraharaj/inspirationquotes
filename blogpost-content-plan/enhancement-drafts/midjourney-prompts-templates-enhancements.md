## Enhancement 1: Prompt Evolution Tips Section

**Location:** After line 553 (after "Experimentation is how you develop your own signature style.")
**Words Added:** ~80

### Content to Add:

### Evolving Your Prompts Over Time

Your prompts should improve with use. Here's how to evolve them systematically:

**Version your prompts.** Keep V1, V2, V3 of your favorites so you can track what changed and why outputs improved.

**Build from failures.** When a prompt produces bad results, analyze why. Was the subject unclear? Conflicting style directions? Add those learnings to future prompts.

**Cross-pollinate.** Take successful elements from one category and test them in another. The lighting from portrait photography templates often elevates product shots too.

## Enhancement 2: Style Combination Guidance Expansion

**Location:** After line 553 (continuing from "Combining Template Elements" section)
**Words Added:** ~75

### Content to Add:

### Effective Style Combinations

Not all style combinations work equally well. These pairings consistently produce interesting results:

**Photo-realism + Mood:** Combine `--style raw` with atmospheric elements like fog, rain, or dramatic lighting for images that feel both real and emotionally evocative.

**Anime + Architecture:** Use `--niji 6` with architectural subjects for a distinctive illustrative look popular in concept art.

**Cinematic + Portrait:** Apply movie-grade color grading and dramatic lighting to standard portrait setups for images that feel pulled from film stills.
