## 📋 Prompt Template

```
Act as a computer science professor specializing in algorithms.

CONTEXT:
- Current Algorithm: [paste code]
- Current Complexity: O([current])
- Target Complexity: O([target])
- Input Type/Size: [describe constraints]

TASK - Optimize the logic:

Step 1: ALGORITHMIC SUBSTITUTION
Suggest a different algorithm or data structure (e.g., Hash Map vs Array).

Step 2: SPACE-TIME TRADE-OFF
Analyze if using more memory can reduce execution time.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

## Theoretical Improvement
**From:** O([current])
**To:** O([target])

## Proposed Change
[Detailed explanation of the new approach]

## Implementation
[Optimized pseudocode or actual code]
```
