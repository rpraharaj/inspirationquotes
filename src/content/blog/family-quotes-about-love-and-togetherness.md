I remember a rainy Sunday afternoon when my grandfather gathered us all around the old oak dining table. There were no phones, no televisions humming in the background—just the sound of rain against the glass and the warmth of a shared pot of tea. He didn't say much, but he pointed to a small wooden carving on the wall that read, "A family is a circle of love, not broken by a whisper." That moment stayed with me forever, reminding me that togetherness isn't about grand gestures, but about being present.
