Last night, my partner and I spent twenty minutes arguing about the "correct" way to load the dishwasher. In the heat of the moment, it felt like a trial of character. But then, I caught my reflection in the toaster—hair messy, holding a spatula like a weapon—and I just started laughing. That's the thing about love; if you aren't laughing at the absurdity of sharing a life with another human, you're probably doing it wrong.

That's the magic of funny love quotes—they're like a pressure valve for the soul. They remind us that we're all a little bit crazy, and finding someone whose crazy matches yours is the ultimate win.
