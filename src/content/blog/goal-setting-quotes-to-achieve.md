I used to treat goal setting like a New Year's Eve ritual—scribbling big dreams on a napkin, only to find it buried in a drawer three months later, completely forgotten. I had the ambition, but I lacked the roadmap. It wasn't until I started treating my goals as commitments rather than wishes that things actually started to shift.

There is a profound difference between wanting something and planning for it. I've found that the right words at the right time can be the bridge between a vague idea and a concrete plan. When the excitement fades and the real work begins, we all need a reminder of why we started in the first place.

Here are 150 goal-setting quotes to help you clarify your vision, stick to your plan, and cross that finish line.
