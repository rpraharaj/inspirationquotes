It was during those quiet, heavy nights that I realized how much I leaned on a few simple words of wisdom to keep my head above water.

Whether you're navigating a major life transition or just need a reminder that better days are ahead, these words have been my companions, and I hope they become yours too.

Here are 150 powerful, bite-sized quotes to fuel your goals and keep you moving forward. We've organized them into themes that address the different ways hope and faith show up in our lives, from the quiet resilience of inner peace to the bold courage required for new beginnings.
