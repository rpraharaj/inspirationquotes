Last summer, I found myself sitting by a small lake, clutching a journal filled with regrets I couldn't seem to shake. I was exhausted from trying to control every outcome and replay every mistake in my head. It wasn't until I read a simple line by Rumi—"Life is a balance between holding on and letting go"—that I realized my grip on the past was the only thing keeping me from the peace I so desperately craved.
