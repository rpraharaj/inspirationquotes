Last year, during one of our most intense project cycles, I found myself sitting at my desk at 7:00 PM, feeling completely drained. The deadlines were looming, and the "to-do" list seemed to be growing rather than shrinking. Just as I was about to close my laptop for the night, a simple Slack message popped up from my manager: *"I see how much effort you're putting into this, and I want you to know it's making a massive difference. We couldn't do this without you."*

That one sentence didn't finish the project for me, but it changed everything about how I felt while doing it. The exhaustion didn't vanish, but it was suddenly balanced by a sense of purpose and belonging. That's the magic of appreciation at work—it's an espresso shot for the soul.

We all want to feel that our contributions matter. Whether you're a leader looking to inspire your team or a colleague wanting to show some love to your work-bestie, these 150 quotes about appreciation at work will help you find the right words.
