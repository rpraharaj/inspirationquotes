Last week, I found myself sitting at my kitchen table, staring at a mounting pile of bills and a laptop screen full of unanswered emails. I felt overwhelmed, stretched thin, and honestly, a bit resentful. It's easy to fall into the trap of focusing on what's missing, isn't it? We get so caught up in the "next thing" that we forget to look at the "now thing."

That's when I picked up an old journal and saw a note I'd written to myself months ago: "Gratitude isn't a reaction to good things; it's a way of seeing the world."

I've found that finding the right words can be the spark that reignites that sense of appreciation. Whether you're having a tough day or just want to start your morning on a positive note, these quotes about being thankful are like espresso shots for the soul. They remind us that there is always, always something to be grateful for.
