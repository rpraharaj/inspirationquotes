Last Tuesday, I found myself sitting on my porch with a lukewarm cup of tea, just watching a cardinal hop around in the grass. For a few minutes, the stress of my to-do list vanished.

## Final Reflections on Finding Joy

Finding joy in small things isn't about ignoring the difficulties of life. It's about choosing where to place your attention. When we practice noticing the small beauties—the steam rising from a mug, the sound of the wind, the feeling of a warm blanket—we build a reservoir of resilience.

I've personally seen how a simple five-minute gratitude practice can shift an entire week's perspective. Today, I challenge you to find just three small things that make you smile. Don't wait for the big victory. Celebrate the tiny ones. They are, after all, what life is truly made of.
