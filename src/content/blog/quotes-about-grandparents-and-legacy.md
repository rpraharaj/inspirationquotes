There's a special kind of magic that lives in a grandparent's home. I still remember the smell of cinnamon and old books that filled my grandmother’s kitchen—a place where time seemed to slow down and every problem could be solved with a cup of tea and a story. It wasn't just about the treats; it was about the feeling of being connected to something much larger than myself. These moments shaped my understanding of what it means to belong to a family.

I've found that as we get older, we start to realize that our grandparents aren't just relatives; they are the living bridges to our past.
