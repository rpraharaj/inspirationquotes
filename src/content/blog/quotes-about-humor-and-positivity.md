I've always believed that a well-timed joke is more than just a distraction—it's a survival tool. There have been weeks where my to-do list felt like a mountain and my energy felt like a puddle, but then a single witty observation from a friend or a classic one-liner from a favorite author would suddenly shift the atmosphere. It didn't change the facts of my situation, but it completely changed how I felt about them.

In my own life, I've found that positivity isn't about ignoring the hard stuff; it's about having the sense of humor to see the absurdity in it. Laughter provides a momentary "pause button" on stress, allowing us to catch our breath and approach our challenges with a clearer head. It's the "spark of madness" that Robin Williams famously told us never to lose, because that spark is often what lights our way back to joy.

Here are 150 of my favorite quotes about humor and positivity to help you find the light, even on the days when you're looking for the exit.
