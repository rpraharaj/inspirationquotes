I’ve always believed that a day without laughter is a day wasted, but it wasn't until a few years ago that I truly understood why. I was going through a particularly heavy season—the kind where your feet feel like lead and even the sun seems a bit too bright. One afternoon, my niece did something so accidentally ridiculous that I couldn't help it; I erupted into a belly laugh that left me gasping for air. In that moment, the weight didn't disappear, but it shifted.

That’s the thing about joy—it isn't the absence of trouble; it's the presence of light in the middle of it. I started collecting these quotes because I realized I needed reminders that laughter isn't just a reaction; it's a choice and a lifeline. Whether you're celebrating a mountaintop moment or just trying to find a reason to smile today, these words are for you.

Here are 150 of my favorite quotes about laughter and joy to help you find that spark again. We all deserve to feel that lightness in our chests, and sometimes, a few well-chosen words are all it takes to open the door.
