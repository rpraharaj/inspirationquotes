Last year, I hit a wall that felt like a permanent dead end. I had spent months working on a project that I was certain would be a breakthrough, only to watch it fall apart in a single afternoon due to a series of avoidable errors I'd made. The weight of that failure was crushing, and for weeks, I couldn't look at a notebook without feeling a pang of regret.

But then, I stumbled across a simple line by James Joyce: "Mistakes are the portals of discovery." That one sentence shifted my perspective entirely. I stopped seeing my errors as evidence of my inadequacy and started viewing them as data points on a map. I realized that every stumble wasn't a sign to stop, but a signal of where I needed to adjust my footing.

These quotes about learning from mistakes serve as that same reminder for me whenever I face a setback. They aren't just pretty words; they're espresso shots of wisdom that help me refocus, get back up, and try again with more intelligence. If you're feeling the sting of a recent error, I hope these words provide the same comfort and clarity they gave me.

Here are 150 powerful, bite-sized quotes to help you embrace your mistakes and use them as fuel for your goals.
