Last year, I found myself in a new city where I didn't know a single soul. Standing in a crowded coffee shop, I realized how much I'd taken my old friendships for granted. Making new friends as an adult can feel like navigating a minefield of awkward "hellos" and uncertain small talk. It's a vulnerable process, but I've learned that every deep connection starts with a simple moment of courage.

These quotes about making new friends became my companions during those first few months. They reminded me that everyone is looking for connection, and that a stranger is often just a friend you haven't spoken to yet. Whether you're moving to a new place or just want to expand your social circle, I hope these words give you the inspiration to reach out.

Here are 150 powerful, bite-sized quotes to fuel your social journey and help you build meaningful new bonds.
