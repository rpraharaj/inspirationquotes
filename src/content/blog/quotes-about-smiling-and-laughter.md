But a few years ago, during a particularly stressful month when everything seemed to be going wrong, I realized I had it backward. I was waiting for a reason to smile, when what I actually needed was to smile to find my way back to the light.

There's something transformative about the simple act of turning the corners of your mouth upward. It's like a tiny physical rebellion against the weight of the world.
