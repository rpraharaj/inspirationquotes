Sometimes, the most profound things are best said in just a few words. I've always found that a quick text to a friend can completely change the trajectory of their day, and mine too. We often wait for big occasions to express our gratitude, but it's the small, consistent reminders of "I'm here for you" that build the strongest bonds.

Last Tuesday, I was feeling overwhelmed with a project when a friend sent me a simple three-word text: "You've got this." That was it.

Whether you're looking for something to add to a birthday card, a social media caption, or just a random "thinking of you" message, these bite-sized words carry a lot of weight.

Here are 150 powerful, short friendship quotes to help you celebrate the people who make life a little brighter.
