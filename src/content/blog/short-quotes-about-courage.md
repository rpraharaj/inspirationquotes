I used to think that courage was something you were either born with or you weren't. I imagined it as this grand, cinematic quality reserved for heroes in books or movies. But as I've navigated the ups and downs of my own life—from career shifts that terrified me to personal moments where I had to stand my ground—I've realized that courage is much smaller and more accessible than that. It's often found in the quietest moments, not the loudest ones.

There have been days when I felt completely paralyzed by fear, unable to make a simple decision because I was so afraid of the outcome. In those moments, I didn't need a three-hour lecture on psychology or a thick biography of a world leader. What I needed was a spark. I needed a single, punchy sentence that could cut through the noise of my anxiety and remind me that I'm stronger than I feel. I've found that short, bite-sized quotes are like "espresso shots" for the soul—concentrated wisdom that hits fast and stays with you.

I've gathered these 150 short quotes about courage for those exact moments of doubt. I've curated these words because they've helped me "saddle up" even when my knees were shaking. Whether you're facing a major life change or just trying to get through a difficult Tuesday, I hope these words provide the same strength for you that they have for me.
