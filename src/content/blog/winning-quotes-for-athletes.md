I remember standing on the starting line of my first major track meet, heart pounding so hard I thought everyone could hear it. The doubt creeping in was louder than the crowd. But then I remembered a simple line my coach had drilled into us: "You don't train to be average." That shift in perspective—from fear to focused aggression—changed everything for me that day.

Winning isn't just about the scoreboard; it's a mentality that starts long before the game begins. It's the refusal to settle, the commitment to the grind when no one is watching, and the resilience to get back up when you've been knocked down.
